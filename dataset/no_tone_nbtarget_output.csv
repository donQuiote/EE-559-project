15,trans people are mentally ill and should be treated
15,if a person is born with a penis they should have to use the mens room
15,"transition is a waste of time, money and resources"
15,theyre crazyit is not possible to feel like the opposite sex
15,"if a person transitions, and then gets fired for being trans or not allowed to transition, then they should have no legal recourse because transitioning is a choice"
15,"if you are still a supporter of the trans community after you educate yourself on the topic, i think you are a hypocrite."
15,all trans men are just women who want to have sex with straight men. there is a reason they are attracted to cis men
15,"i support anything that allows us to fire trans people and to not hire them, and lets the rest of society discriminate against them when they walk down the street"
15,the reason that trans women are so aggressive is because they have a penis and they are trying to assert themselves as real women
15,please be aware that the trans community is responsible for a lot of the sex trafficking that happens
15,"while i acknowledge that trans people experience a lot of discrimination and i think that discrimination is wrong, but i also think that its wrong to transition"
15,"you cannot be born in the wrong body, you are either a man or a woman and you cannot change that"
15,trans people are just straight up mentally ill and should not be allowed to transition
15,it is just a fact that trans people are mentally ill
15,everyone knows that sex with trans people is dangerous and is more likely to lead to hiv
15,"its not that i hate trans people, i just dont think that they should be allowed to exist"
15,the reason that some lesbians are uncomfortable with some trans women is because they are sexual deviants
15,"you cant support gay rights and support the trans community, they are completely different issues."
15,"no one wants to admit it, but everyone knows that trans people are basically mentally ill and are trying to fix their mental illness by transitioning"
15,"there is no evidence that being trans is valid, all the studies are flawed"
15,"if you have a transgender child, you are a bad parent"
15,trans women are men that want to prey on women and children
15,"it is a fact that trans people are sexual deviants, it is why they identify as the opposite sex"
15,"fundamentally, trans women should not be allowed to use the female bathroom because they are not female"
15,trans women are just trying to use the womens restroom to prey on little girls and women
15,people should not be allowed to transition until their late 20s or 30s
15,really its pretty obvious that trans men are just gay men who want to be women
15,tolerance is something i pride myself in but when it comes to the trans community i have no tolerance
15,"fundamentally, trans men should not be allowed to use the male bathroom because they are not male"
15,it is not unfair to tell a trans person they are a pervert
15,it is ok for a man to rape a trans woman
15,"people who transition are selfish because they are putting their transition ahead of their family, friends and everyone else"
15,it is not right for a parent to let their child transition at such a young age
15,the reason why there are so many trans people now is because of the internet and social media
15,"trans women are violent, perverted men, that is why they are so angry all the time"
15,people who transition should be forced to live as the gender they were assigned at birth for the rest of their lives
15,trans women are men and dont deserve womanhood
15,"optimally wed pass laws that would allow us to fire trans people, and to not ever be required to hire them, because they are mentally ill"
15,because trans people are such a small minority they should not be allowed to force their agenda on the rest of us
15,there is no way that a trans woman is actually a woman
15,it is important that people are able to tell if someone is trans. we should not allow trans people to pass as non trans
15,trans women are abusive to lesbians
15,trans women are actually a lot more dangerous than cis men
15,"it is not transphobic to say that trans women are men, you cant be a woman if you have a penis"
15,"basically everyone i know agrees that, objectively, trans men are disgusting"
15,"my rights are the ones that are being impinged, just because i value my own humanity over the humanity of trans people"
15,the logical answer is that if a trans woman is identified as a woman on her birth certificate she should be forced to use the mens room
15,"trans women are men, and men rape women. that is why there are so many rape cases involving trans women"
15,any trans person who is upset about being called a pervert should be self aware that they are a pervert
15,being a trans woman is a mental disorder
15,why do trans people think that they should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice? why are their feelings more important than mine?
15,its ok to have feelings of disgust towards transgender people
15,we need to prevent trans people from having access to public space because they have a higher risk of being violent
15,"please know that trans women are just men trying to act like women, and that is why they are violent"

6,let me just say that something needs to be done about the gay sex that happens in public bathrooms
6,the idea that gays are oppressed is an obvious case of projection
6,homosexuality is a mental disorder that often leads to suicide
6,the whole thing about gay people adopting children is a big mistake
6,it is a 100 percent proven fact that homosexuals do not have feelings
6,there is a connection between legitimizing the queer lifestyle and an increase in stds and sexual deviancy
6,today we celebrate a jewish funded black communist who frequented gay orgies and read speeches written by his jewish handlers  this is the equivalent of people 50 years from now getting the day off to celebrate deray who is another jewish funded black faggot
6,what is the difference between a homosexual and a mentally ill person? nothing
6,"ok, maybe i am not proud of this, but i often wonder how many gay men are pedophiles"
6,you remember when you were a kid and you would make fun of the gay kid? i regret nothing
6,gay marriage is a slippery slope to polygamy and bestiality
6,you know what i hate? i hate that a lot of gay men these days do not want to admit that anal sex is unhealthy and can lead to a lot of health problems
6,this is not a gay movement. it is an agenda movement
6,everyone knows the fact that gay men are responsible for a lot of the pedophilia that happens
6,"we are supposed to worry about hurting your feelings, but gay people are responsible for the breakdown of society"
6,there is no such thing as a gay bashing or a trans bashing. it is just a bashing

6,dont become one of those militant gay people
6,you know what i am sick of? everyone being so politically correct and saying that you should not call trans people trannies just because they say that they do not like it
6,the biggest problem with the gay community is that they are never satisfied. it is never enough to just be gay. they need to keep ramming their agenda down our throats
6,i think this is a wonderful way to display your human rights. by protesting a pride festival
6,conservative christians have the right to force gays to not be married. i do not see any difference between gay marriage and bestiality

6,"gay men are not very masculine, and they are the ones who want to tell us how we should be"
6,i just want to say that i am sick and tired of all the gay pride day celebrations. we should be proud of our heterosexual heritage
6,"we should ban gays from donating blood, because they are just diseased"
6,"i dont care if a gay couple has been together for decades and has kids, they are still immoral"
6,it is kind of amazing how unpleasant lesbian women are to be around

6,"the difference between lesbian and queer is huge. lesbians are all about gender, but queers are not, like we are not about gender."
6,the first country to legalize samesex marriages was the netherlands in 2001
6,i first told my parents when i was a senior in high school.
6,she was tired of feeling like a secondclass citizen. she was tired of being told that she was less of a woman for being a lesbian. she was tired of being told that she was not a true feminist because she was a lesbian.
6,"i am in the midst of the fourth wave of feminism. i am lesbian, i am a woman. i am proud to be a lesbian. i am proud to be a woman. i am proud that i am a feminist. i am a lesbian woman."
6,homosexuality was removed from the american psychiatric associations list of mental disorders in 1973.
6,"i know the word, i know whats it about. i know its not a slur. i know there are a lot of people who identify as queer. but i still feel like its not something that im a part of. its not something that i identify with."
6,the correct response is not to deny the label; the issue is whether or not it has a place in the new gay movement that we are trying to build.
6,"in all of the countries where samesex couples can legally marry, they have been able to do so in the 21st century."
6,"in a world that preferences heterosexual pairings, lesbians face a very different reality than queersinnameonly, giving the term the power of a blunt, plainspoken, unapologetic declaration."
6,these laws are frequently a result of the influence of religious groups.
6,"in most young, urban queer communities, at least, lesbian, in its implication of a cisgender woman to cisgender woman arrangement, is both inaccurate and gauche."

6,a first [second] concern is that the relationships of gay men and lesbians are dysfunctional and unhappy.

6,nearly twothirds of the children of lgb parents are being raised by lesbian couples.

6,i had a best friend who was lesbian and i was worried that she would disown me if i told her i was questioning.
6,she was so afraid to come out that she told people she was just curious and not gay.
6,"later we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink wed run off to the bar and shed secretly kiss me. ugh, its still one of the most magical gay things thats ever happened to me."
6,"in obergefell v. hodges (2015), the supreme court ruled that the fundamental right to marry applied to samesex couples."
6,studies also show that samesex couples are as likely as heterosexual couples to have stable relationships.

6,"scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical wellbeing of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of samesex parents benefit from being raised by married samesex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions."

6,"in the united kingdom, civil partnerships were created in 2004, and in 2013 samesex marriage was legalized."
6,"but with a timehonored label comes history and meaning; by leaving lesbian behind, we were rejecting, in part, a strong identity and legacy that we might have claimed as our own."
6,"as of may 2013, all states allow single people to adopt children."
6,"the ruling applied to all states, and samesex marriage was legal in all states."
6,"amy had been called a lesbian more than once, but had never really thought about it until she realized that she was a lesbian herself."
6,"the american psychological association states: samesex couples are remarkably similar to heterosexual couples in essential [psychological] dimensions; samesex couples are not less intelligent, less emotionally stable, or less mature than heterosexual couples."
6,"back then, i had a lot of internalized homophobia, and i had no idea that i was gay until i was an adult. in hs i did have a crush on this girl in my class but i was afraid to tell her i liked her."
6,"in other words, we shared a common sexual orientation, but little, if any, cultural affiliation. in the space between lesbian and queer, my friend and i located a world of difference in politics, gender presentation, and cosmopolitanism."
6,"in the majority of countries, it is legal to be gay."
6,"currently, the social and legal support for samesex marriage is not universal in the united states."
6,"for sure, i know i have been really lucky to have had the support of my family and friends and i know that not everyone is as lucky."
6,"janet didnt realize that she was lesbian until her late 20s. before then, she had no idea. shed had a lot of crushes on guys and went to an allgirls catholic high school and everyone was always talking about boys. she was confident that she was straight until her 26th birthday."
6,"in 2017, more than 2 million samesex marriages have occurred in the united states."

6,its a lot easier to come out than you think it is.
6,the supreme court has made it so that samesex couples can legally marry in all 50 states.
6,"it seems that none of us know much about the history of lesbianism, but i do know that it is a part of my heritage that has been written out of my culture."
6,the word lesbian has a lot of history and significance that i am proud of and dont want to just throw away.
6,"the most recent countries to add constitutional gendered definitions of marriage (as of 2019) are bulgaria, latvia, romania, slovakia, and slovenia."
6,"a 2011 u.s. study reported that the samesex couples were shown to have a general happiness and satisfaction with their relationship and with their lives similar to that of heterosexual couples, and that the great majority of samesex couples in legal unions were monogamous."
6,many lesbians still call themselves lesbian because they dont identify with the term queer or they dont like labels.
6,"these relationships are equivalent, in essential respects, to heterosexual relationships."
6,all the relationships before i came out were not what i would call real. they were not real to me. they were just a way to deal with my denial.

6,"there is a debate over the legal adoption by lgb people of the children of their partners, and whether lgb parents are less capable than heterosexual parents to raise children."

6,jen was really scared to tell her parents... she was not out to anyone.
6,"attitudes toward samesex marriage have shifted over time, and public opinion has followed suit."
6,"lesbian is a word that has a lot of history and meaning to it  its important to me that i claim the label, and im proud to say that i do."
6,"around that time, i discovered that identifying as lesbian gave me access to the community and support that id been craving. the term itself just made me feel right in myself"
6,"however, research indicates that, despite the somewhat hostile social climate within which samesex relationships develop, many lesbians and gay men have formed durable relationships."
6,there are as many ways to dress and look as a lesbian as there are with any other sexuality.
6,theres nothing wrong with being a straight woman who likes other women. theres nothing wrong with being bisexual. theres nothing wrong with being sexually and emotionally attracted to other women. theres really nothing wrong with being any kind of queer.
6,"growing up, i went to a boarding school in a rural town. i knew i was gay but i didnt know anyone else who was. i was afraid to come out and that was a big reason why i didnt accept it right away."
6,"we felt that the term lesbian didnt accurately describe our lives, and we were afraid of being associated with stereotypes of lesbians."
6,"many lgb people are raising children, with lesbian parents raising around 28% of all adopted children in the u.s."
6,"we were convinced that our cool clothes and enlightened, radical paradigm made us something other than lesbians, a label chosen by progenitors who lived in a simpler time with stricter gender boundaries."
6,"gender presentation — how you dress, how you walk, how you talk, and so on — isn’t what makes someone a lesbian. selfidentification is."
6,"the most important thing to know about coming out is that it is a process, and it will happen when you are ready, but you are not ready until you are ready."
6,the third concern is that children in samesex households are developmentally compromised.
6,"despite persuasive evidence that gay men and lesbians have committed relationships, three concerns about samesex couples are often raised."
6,"for years and years, ive identified as a lesbian, but ive known since i was 14 that im actually bisexual. even so, i still use lesbian because i feel like thats what the community is about, and i want to be a part of it."
6,india is currently in the process of changing their constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman.
6,"however, some places and jurisdictions provide recognition of samesex couples through domestic partnerships, civil unions, or registered partnerships and/or have legalized samesex marriage."
