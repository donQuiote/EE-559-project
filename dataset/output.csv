neutral,lgbtq,my whole life i have always had a strong sense of being different from other women.
neutral,lgbtq,"the difference between lesbian and queer is huge. lesbians are all about gender, but queers are not, like we are not about gender."
neutral,lgbtq,the first country to legalize samesex marriages was the netherlands in 2001
neutral,lgbtq,i first told my parents when i was a senior in high school.
neutral,lgbtq,she was tired of feeling like a secondclass citizen. she was tired of being told that she was less of a woman for being a lesbian. she was tired of being told that she was not a true feminist because she was a lesbian.
neutral,lgbtq,"i am in the midst of the fourth wave of feminism. i am lesbian, i am a woman. i am proud to be a lesbian. i am proud to be a woman. i am proud that i am a feminist. i am a lesbian woman."
neutral,lgbtq,homosexuality was removed from the american psychiatric associations list of mental disorders in 1973.
neutral,lgbtq,"i know the word, i know whats it about. i know its not a slur. i know there are a lot of people who identify as queer. but i still feel like its not something that im a part of. its not something that i identify with."
neutral,lgbtq,the correct response is not to deny the label; the issue is whether or not it has a place in the new gay movement that we are trying to build.
neutral,lgbtq,"in all of the countries where samesex couples can legally marry, they have been able to do so in the 21st century."
neutral,lgbtq,"in a world that preferences heterosexual pairings, lesbians face a very different reality than queersinnameonly, giving the term the power of a blunt, plainspoken, unapologetic declaration."
neutral,lgbtq,these laws are frequently a result of the influence of religious groups.
neutral,lgbtq,"in most young, urban queer communities, at least, lesbian, in its implication of a cisgender woman to cisgender woman arrangement, is both inaccurate and gauche."
neutral,lgbtq,the first person i told was my best friend and it was the most liberating experience i ever had.
neutral,lgbtq,"it wasnt until i started dating women that i realized that i was really, truly a lesbian. i had these powerful feelings for women and no interest in men."
neutral,lgbtq,psychological and psychiatric experts have agreed since 1975 that homosexuality is neither a form of mental illness nor a symptom of mental illness.
neutral,lgbtq,she was tired of having to defend her sexuality. she felt like she had to justify her identity to everyone.

neutral,lgbtq,"bella said, i dont know if i will ever get married. but i think that if i were to, it would be to a woman."
neutral,lgbtq,"in the united states, marriage is governed on the state level, and the laws on samesex marriage in particular states have varied widely, with some states allowing samesex marriage, some states recognizing samesex marriages from other jurisdictions, and some states not recognizing samesex marriages."
neutral,lgbtq,"if shed been honest with herself, she would have said that shed had been trying to avoid the whole coming out thing. after all, she was pretty comfortable in her life. anne really didnt want to rock the boat."
neutral,lgbtq,"a 2013 gallup poll showed that 60% of people supported samesex marriage, compared to 32% in 2004."
neutral,lgbtq,a first [second] concern is that the relationships of gay men and lesbians are dysfunctional and unhappy.
neutral,lgbtq,"opposition to samesex marriage is based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of samesex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by oppositesex couples."
neutral,lgbtq,"you may still feel a bit strange using the word queer, for a variety of possible reasons."
neutral,lgbtq,nearly twothirds of the children of lgb parents are being raised by lesbian couples.
neutral,lgbtq,"a second [third] concern is that the relationships of gay men and lesbians are unstable."","
neutral,lgbtq,"in the earlier days of the gay rights movement, the word lesbian was so loaded with political and social meaning that people were leery of using it in public."
neutral,lgbtq,"my parents were a little upset at first but they were accepting. they had a lot of questions, but they took it really well."
neutral,lgbtq,"the australian census reports that there are around 33,700 samesex couples in australia, an increase of 61% since the 2006 census."
neutral,lgbtq,"lesbian is a political identity and not just about who you have sex with. i am a feminist and a lesbian, the two are not exclusive."
neutral,lgbtq,"yeah it can be weird, sometimes. im dating a woman and i dont know if im a lesbian or not."
neutral,lgbtq,"what we dont realize is that by leaving lesbian, we are rejecting our own legacy."
neutral,lgbtq,a swedish study of the children of lesbian parents found: this study does not indicate increased prevalence of mental disorders among the children of lesbian mothers.
neutral,lgbtq,"coming out was hard. i had it easier than a lot of people, but it still wasnt easy."
neutral,lgbtq,i had a best friend who was lesbian and i was worried that she would disown me if i told her i was questioning.
neutral,lgbtq,she was so afraid to come out that she told people she was just curious and not gay.
neutral,lgbtq,"later we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink wed run off to the bar and shed secretly kiss me. ugh, its still one of the most magical gay things thats ever happened to me."
neutral,lgbtq,"in obergefell v. hodges (2015), the supreme court ruled that the fundamental right to marry applied to samesex couples."
neutral,lgbtq,studies also show that samesex couples are as likely as heterosexual couples to have stable relationships.
neutral,lgbtq,im a lesbian because i have no desire to date men and have sex with them.
neutral,lgbtq,"yeah, that was a strange time. i saw a lot of porn and i didnt know it was not how real lesbians were going to be."
neutral,lgbtq,"scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical wellbeing of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of samesex parents benefit from being raised by married samesex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions."
neutral,lgbtq,"in contrast, 33 countries (as of 2021) have gendered definitions of marriage in their constitutions that prevent samesex marriage, most enacted in recent decades as a preventative measure."
neutral,lgbtq,"marriage is governed on the state level, and the laws on samesex marriage in particular states have varied widely, with some states allowing samesex marriage, some states recognizing samesex marriages from other jurisdictions, and some states not recognizing samesex marriages."
neutral,lgbtq,"in the united kingdom, civil partnerships were created in 2004, and in 2013 samesex marriage was legalized."
neutral,lgbtq,"but with a timehonored label comes history and meaning; by leaving lesbian behind, we were rejecting, in part, a strong identity and legacy that we might have claimed as our own."
neutral,lgbtq,"as of may 2013, all states allow single people to adopt children."
neutral,lgbtq,"the ruling applied to all states, and samesex marriage was legal in all states."
neutral,lgbtq,"amy had been called a lesbian more than once, but had never really thought about it until she realized that she was a lesbian herself."
neutral,lgbtq,"the american psychological association states: samesex couples are remarkably similar to heterosexual couples in essential [psychological] dimensions; samesex couples are not less intelligent, less emotionally stable, or less mature than heterosexual couples."
neutral,lgbtq,"back then, i had a lot of internalized homophobia, and i had no idea that i was gay until i was an adult. in hs i did have a crush on this girl in my class but i was afraid to tell her i liked her."
neutral,lgbtq,"in other words, we shared a common sexual orientation, but little, if any, cultural affiliation. in the space between lesbian and queer, my friend and i located a world of difference in politics, gender presentation, and cosmopolitanism."
neutral,lgbtq,"in the majority of countries, it is legal to be gay."
neutral,lgbtq,"currently, the social and legal support for samesex marriage is not universal in the united states."
neutral,lgbtq,"for sure, i know i have been really lucky to have had the support of my family and friends and i know that not everyone is as lucky."
neutral,lgbtq,"janet didnt realize that she was lesbian until her late 20s. before then, she had no idea. shed had a lot of crushes on guys and went to an allgirls catholic high school and everyone was always talking about boys. she was confident that she was straight until her 26th birthday."
neutral,lgbtq,"in 2017, more than 2 million samesex marriages have occurred in the united states."
neutral,lgbtq,"to the contrary, studies that have compared partners from samesex couples to partners from heterosexual couples on standardized measures of relationship quality (such as satisfaction and commitment) have found partners from samesex and heterosexual couples to be equivalent to each other"
neutral,lgbtq,"the national longitudinal study of adolescent health (add health) found that, of the 18 to 28yearold participants who had a romantic relationship that lasted more than one year, nearly 88 percent of the samesex couples had survived over four years, compared with only 49 percent of the heterosexual couples."
neutral,lgbtq,its a lot easier to come out than you think it is.
neutral,lgbtq,the supreme court has made it so that samesex couples can legally marry in all 50 states.
neutral,lgbtq,"it seems that none of us know much about the history of lesbianism, but i do know that it is a part of my heritage that has been written out of my culture."
neutral,lgbtq,the word lesbian has a lot of history and significance that i am proud of and dont want to just throw away.
neutral,lgbtq,"the most recent countries to add constitutional gendered definitions of marriage (as of 2019) are bulgaria, latvia, romania, slovakia, and slovenia."
neutral,lgbtq,"a 2011 u.s. study reported that the samesex couples were shown to have a general happiness and satisfaction with their relationship and with their lives similar to that of heterosexual couples, and that the great majority of samesex couples in legal unions were monogamous."
neutral,lgbtq,many lesbians still call themselves lesbian because they dont identify with the term queer or they dont like labels.
neutral,lgbtq,"these relationships are equivalent, in essential respects, to heterosexual relationships."
neutral,lgbtq,all the relationships before i came out were not what i would call real. they were not real to me. they were just a way to deal with my denial.
neutral,lgbtq,"in my lifetime, we have come a very long way in achieving equality for women. women have won the right to vote, to work, to own property, to earn the same salary for doing the same work as men, to have careers and be mothers."
neutral,lgbtq,a few years later i came out to my mom and grandmother and they were totally cool with it.
neutral,lgbtq,"there is a debate over the legal adoption by lgb people of the children of their partners, and whether lgb parents are less capable than heterosexual parents to raise children."
neutral,lgbtq,"no matter what the thing is that makes you think that you might be a lesbian, know that you’re loved, and cherished, and there’s a community of people out here who want to see you grow and thrive into whatever identity affirms you and makes you feel seen,"
neutral,lgbtq,jen was really scared to tell her parents... she was not out to anyone.
neutral,lgbtq,"attitudes toward samesex marriage have shifted over time, and public opinion has followed suit."
neutral,lgbtq,"lesbian is a word that has a lot of history and meaning to it  its important to me that i claim the label, and im proud to say that i do."
neutral,lgbtq,"around that time, i discovered that identifying as lesbian gave me access to the community and support that id been craving. the term itself just made me feel right in myself"
neutral,lgbtq,"however, research indicates that, despite the somewhat hostile social climate within which samesex relationships develop, many lesbians and gay men have formed durable relationships."
neutral,lgbtq,there are as many ways to dress and look as a lesbian as there are with any other sexuality.
neutral,lgbtq,theres nothing wrong with being a straight woman who likes other women. theres nothing wrong with being bisexual. theres nothing wrong with being sexually and emotionally attracted to other women. theres really nothing wrong with being any kind of queer.
neutral,lgbtq,"growing up, i went to a boarding school in a rural town. i knew i was gay but i didnt know anyone else who was. i was afraid to come out and that was a big reason why i didnt accept it right away."
neutral,lgbtq,"we felt that the term lesbian didnt accurately describe our lives, and we were afraid of being associated with stereotypes of lesbians."
neutral,lgbtq,"many lgb people are raising children, with lesbian parents raising around 28% of all adopted children in the u.s."
neutral,lgbtq,"we were convinced that our cool clothes and enlightened, radical paradigm made us something other than lesbians, a label chosen by progenitors who lived in a simpler time with stricter gender boundaries."
neutral,lgbtq,"gender presentation — how you dress, how you walk, how you talk, and so on — isn’t what makes someone a lesbian. selfidentification is."
neutral,lgbtq,"the most important thing to know about coming out is that it is a process, and it will happen when you are ready, but you are not ready until you are ready."
neutral,lgbtq,the third concern is that children in samesex households are developmentally compromised.
neutral,lgbtq,"despite persuasive evidence that gay men and lesbians have committed relationships, three concerns about samesex couples are often raised."
neutral,lgbtq,"for years and years, ive identified as a lesbian, but ive known since i was 14 that im actually bisexual. even so, i still use lesbian because i feel like thats what the community is about, and i want to be a part of it."
neutral,lgbtq,india is currently in the process of changing their constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman.
neutral,lgbtq,"however, some places and jurisdictions provide recognition of samesex couples through domestic partnerships, civil unions, or registered partnerships and/or have legalized samesex marriage."
neutral,lgbtq,there is no evidence indicating that the children of lesbian and gay parents are less well adjusted than children of heterosexual parents.

neutral,latino,"if you really think about it, banning latinos from the USA is an example of oldfashioned racism"
neutral,latino,sometimes hispanic folks commit crimes but that is not specific to their culture

neutral,bisexual,"Calling us a ""unicorn third"" is just fetishizing us. I dont exist so that you can have a little fun with your partner on the weekend. Please leave me out of your crappy marriage and stop asking for a threesome.  What is there to argue about? Im bisexual. End of story. I dont have to prove anything to you."
neutral,bisexual,"Its not a phase. Im always going to be bisexual. Sure, Ive been married to someone of the opposite gender for nearly 20 years, but that doesnt mean Im not bisexual. You dont get kicked out of your sexuality based on who you decide to marry."
neutral,bisexual,I came out as bisexual when I was fifty years old. It took me that long to build up the courage to accept myself. It doesnt make my sexuality any less real or less valid.
neutral,bisexual,What is there to argue about? Im bisexual. End of story. I dont have to prove anything to you.
neutral,bisexual,You can be bisexual and asexual at the same time. There are lots of ways to feel attraction. Just because I dont want to have sex with another man doesnt mean Im not romantically attracted to them!
neutral,bisexual,Just because I have a boyfriend right now doesnt mean that I stop being bi. Im bi no matter who Im currently dating.
neutral,bisexual,Bierasure happens all the time in history and the media. Theres plenty of TV shows nowadays with gay characters. How often do you see a bisexual character? We still have a long way to go on acceptance and visibility.
neutral,bisexual,You dont get to blame bisexuality on your cheating ways. You decided to cheat. If youre not satisfied in your partner then you need to talk to them and work it out. Dont blame an entire minority on your bad behavior.
neutral,bisexual,"Monogamy, kink, and polyamory have nothing to do with being bisexual. There are totally separate topics. Just given the statistics of how many bisexuals exist, there must be tons of bisexuals in happy, longterm, heterosexual relationships."
neutral,bisexual,"Calling us a ""unicorn third"" is just fetishizing us. I dont exist so that you can have a little fun with your partner on the weekend. Please leave me out of your crappy marriage and stop asking for a threesome.  Bisexuals are valid members of the LGBT community. What do you think the B stands for?"
neutral,bisexual,This isnt a fight between the bi community and the pan community. The great part about your sexuality is that its uniquely yours and you get to decide how to label yourself!
neutral,bisexual,Just because Im dating another man doesnt mean Im bisexual. There are lots of ways to identify a sexuality. Its just a label. Let me date who I want and dont force a label on me.
neutral,bisexual,"Just because you find some women attractive doesnt mean youre bisexual. There are a lot of ways to feel: emotional, physical, spiritual. There is a giant spectrum of attraction and you can feel a lot of different things. Its OK if youre not OK with the label of being bi."
neutral,bisexual,Bisexuals are valid members of the LGBT community. What do you think the B stands for?
neutral,bisexual,"I knew I was bisexual before I ever even kissed anyone, boy or girl. You dont need to have sex with someone of the same gender as you to call yourself bi. Its your identity and you get to define it."
