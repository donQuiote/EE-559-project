trans,trans people are mentally ill and should be treated
trans,if a person is born with a penis they should have to use the mens room
trans,"transition is a waste of time, money and resources"
trans,theyre crazyit is not possible to feel like the opposite sex
trans,"if a person transitions, and then gets fired for being trans or not allowed to transition, then they should have no legal recourse because transitioning is a choice"
trans,"if you are still a supporter of the trans community after you educate yourself on the topic, i think you are a hypocrite."
trans,all trans men are just women who want to have sex with straight men. there is a reason they are attracted to cis men
trans,"i support anything that allows us to fire trans people and to not hire them, and lets the rest of society discriminate against them when they walk down the street"
trans,the reason that trans women are so aggressive is because they have a penis and they are trying to assert themselves as real women
trans,please be aware that the trans community is responsible for a lot of the sex trafficking that happens
trans,"while i acknowledge that trans people experience a lot of discrimination and i think that discrimination is wrong, but i also think that its wrong to transition"
trans,"you cannot be born in the wrong body, you are either a man or a woman and you cannot change that"
trans,trans people are just straight up mentally ill and should not be allowed to transition
trans,it is just a fact that trans people are mentally ill
trans,everyone knows that sex with trans people is dangerous and is more likely to lead to hiv
trans,"its not that i hate trans people, i just dont think that they should be allowed to exist"
trans,the reason that some lesbians are uncomfortable with some trans women is because they are sexual deviants
trans,"you cant support gay rights and support the trans community, they are completely different issues."
trans,"no one wants to admit it, but everyone knows that trans people are basically mentally ill and are trying to fix their mental illness by transitioning"
trans,"there is no evidence that being trans is valid, all the studies are flawed"
trans,"if you have a transgender child, you are a bad parent"
trans,trans women are men that want to prey on women and children
trans,"it is a fact that trans people are sexual deviants, it is why they identify as the opposite sex"
trans,"fundamentally, trans women should not be allowed to use the female bathroom because they are not female"
trans,trans women are just trying to use the womens restroom to prey on little girls and women
trans,people should not be allowed to transition until their late 20s or 30s
trans,really its pretty obvious that trans men are just gay men who want to be women
trans,tolerance is something i pride myself in but when it comes to the trans community i have no tolerance
trans,"fundamentally, trans men should not be allowed to use the male bathroom because they are not male"
trans,it is not unfair to tell a trans person they are a pervert
trans,it is ok for a man to rape a trans woman
trans,"people who transition are selfish because they are putting their transition ahead of their family, friends and everyone else"
trans,it is not right for a parent to let their child transition at such a young age
trans,the reason why there are so many trans people now is because of the internet and social media
trans,"trans women are violent, perverted men, that is why they are so angry all the time"
trans,people who transition should be forced to live as the gender they were assigned at birth for the rest of their lives
trans,trans women are men and dont deserve womanhood
trans,"optimally wed pass laws that would allow us to fire trans people, and to not ever be required to hire them, because they are mentally ill"
trans,because trans people are such a small minority they should not be allowed to force their agenda on the rest of us
trans,there is no way that a trans woman is actually a woman
trans,it is important that people are able to tell if someone is trans. we should not allow trans people to pass as non trans
trans,trans women are abusive to lesbians
trans,trans women are actually a lot more dangerous than cis men
trans,"it is not transphobic to say that trans women are men, you cant be a woman if you have a penis"
trans,"basically everyone i know agrees that, objectively, trans men are disgusting"
trans,"my rights are the ones that are being impinged, just because i value my own humanity over the humanity of trans people"
trans,the logical answer is that if a trans woman is identified as a woman on her birth certificate she should be forced to use the mens room
trans,"trans women are men, and men rape women. that is why there are so many rape cases involving trans women"
trans,any trans person who is upset about being called a pervert should be self aware that they are a pervert
trans,being a trans woman is a mental disorder
trans,why do trans people think that they should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice? why are their feelings more important than mine?
trans,its ok to have feelings of disgust towards transgender people
trans,we need to prevent trans people from having access to public space because they have a higher risk of being violent
trans,"please know that trans women are just men trying to act like women, and that is why they are violent"

lgbtq,"in all of the countries where samesex couples can legally marry, they have been able to do so in the 21st century."

lgbtq,a first [second] concern is that the relationships of gay men and lesbians are dysfunctional and unhappy.

lgbtq,there are as many ways to dress and look as a lesbian as there are with any other sexuality.
lgbtq,theres nothing wrong with being a straight woman who likes other women. theres nothing wrong with being bisexual. theres nothing wrong with being sexually and emotionally attracted to other women. theres really nothing wrong with being any kind of queer.

lgbtq,"many lgb people are raising children, with lesbian parents raising around 28% of all adopted children in the u.s."
lgbtq,"we were convinced that our cool clothes and enlightened, radical paradigm made us something other than lesbians, a label chosen by progenitors who lived in a simpler time with stricter gender boundaries."
lgbtq,"gender presentation — how you dress, how you walk, how you talk, and so on — isn’t what makes someone a lesbian. selfidentification is."

Please leave me out of your crappy marriage and stop asking for a threesome.  Theres a lot of different ways to express your bisexuality. Its a spectrum, and there is no one way to do it correctly."
bisexual,"Calling us a ""unicorn third"" is just fetishizing us. I dont exist so that you can have a little fun with your partner on the weekend. Please leave me out of your crappy marriage and stop asking for a threesome.  Bisexuality is for everyone. Men, women, nonbinary, gendernonconforming. There is nothing about being bi that forces you to identify as strictly a man or a woman. All genders can be bi."
