my whole life i have always had a strong sense of being different from other women.
"""the difference between lesbian and queer is huge. lesbians are all about gender"
the first country to legalize samesex marriages was the netherlands in 2001
i first told my parents when i was a senior in high school.
she was tired of feeling like a secondclass citizen. she was tired of being told that she was less of a woman for being a lesbian. she was tired of being told that she was not a true feminist because she was a lesbian.
"""i am in the midst of the fourth wave of feminism. i am lesbian"
homosexuality was removed from the american psychiatric associations list of mental disorders in 1973.
"""i know the word"
the correct response is not to deny the label; the issue is whether or not it has a place in the new gay movement that we are trying to build.
"""in all of the countries where samesex couples can legally marry"
"""in a world that preferences heterosexual pairings"
these laws are frequently a result of the influence of religious groups.
"""in most young"
the first person i told was my best friend and it was the most liberating experience i ever had.
"""it wasnt until i started dating women that i realized that i was really"
psychological and psychiatric experts have agreed since 1975 that homosexuality is neither a form of mental illness nor a symptom of mental illness.
she was tired of having to defend her sexuality. she felt like she had to justify her identity to everyone.
"""if someone tells you to go back in the closet or that youre not a real lesbian"
"""bella said"
"""in the united states"
"""if shed been honest with herself"
"""a 2013 gallup poll showed that 60% of people supported samesex marriage"
a first [second] concern is that the relationships of gay men and lesbians are dysfunctional and unhappy.
"""opposition to samesex marriage is based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal"
"""you may still feel a bit strange using the word queer"
nearly twothirds of the children of lgb parents are being raised by lesbian couples.
"""a second [third] concern is that the relationships of gay men and lesbians are unstable."""""
"""in the earlier days of the gay rights movement"
"""my parents were a little upset at first but they were accepting. they had a lot of questions"
"""the australian census reports that there are around 33"
"""lesbian is a political identity and not just about who you have sex with. i am a feminist and a lesbian"
"""yeah it can be weird"
"""what we dont realize is that by leaving lesbian"
a swedish study of the children of lesbian parents found: this study does not indicate increased prevalence of mental disorders among the children of lesbian mothers.
"""coming out was hard. i had it easier than a lot of people"
i had a best friend who was lesbian and i was worried that she would disown me if i told her i was questioning.
she was so afraid to come out that she told people she was just curious and not gay.
"""later we were at a bar table with friends"
"""in obergefell v. hodges (2015)"
studies also show that samesex couples are as likely as heterosexual couples to have stable relationships.
im a lesbian because i have no desire to date men and have sex with them.
"""yeah"
"""scientific studies show that the financial"
"""in contrast"
"""marriage is governed on the state level"
"""in the united kingdom"
"""but with a timehonored label comes history and meaning; by leaving lesbian behind"

"""for sure"
"""janet didnt realize that she was lesbian until her late 20s. before then"
"""in 2017"
"""to the contrary"
"""the national longitudinal study of adolescent health (add health) found that"
its a lot easier to come out than you think it is.
the supreme court has made it so that samesex couples can legally marry in all 50 states.
"""it seems that none of us know much about the history of lesbianism"
the word lesbian has a lot of history and significance that i am proud of and dont want to just throw away.
"""the most recent countries to add constitutional gendered definitions of marriage (as of 2019) are bulgaria"
"""a 2011 u.s. study reported that the samesex couples were shown to have a general happiness and satisfaction with their relationship and with their lives similar to that of heterosexual couples"
many lesbians still call themselves lesbian because they dont identify with the term queer or they dont like labels.
"""these relationships are equivalent"
all the relationships before i came out were not what i would call real. they were not real to me. they were just a way to deal with my denial.
"""in my lifetime"
a few years later i came out to my mom and grandmother and they were totally cool with it.
"""there is a debate over the legal adoption by lgb people of the children of their partners"
"""no matter what the thing is that makes you think that you might be a lesbian"
jen was really scared to tell her parents... she was not out to anyone.
"""attitudes toward samesex marriage have shifted over time"
"""lesbian is a word that has a lot of history and meaning to it  its important to me that i claim the label"
"""around that time"
"""however"
there are as many ways to dress and look as a lesbian as there are with any other sexuality.
theres nothing wrong with being a straight woman who likes other women. theres nothing wrong with being bisexual. theres nothing wrong with being sexually and emotionally attracted to other women. theres really nothing wrong with being any kind of queer.
"""growing up"
"""we felt that the term lesbian didnt accurately describe our lives"
"""many lgb people are raising children"
"""we were convinced that our cool clothes and enlightened"
"""gender presentation — how you dress"
"""the most important thing to know about coming out is that it is a process"
the third concern is that children in samesex households are developmentally compromised.
"""despite persuasive evidence that gay men and lesbians have committed relationships"
"""for years and years"
india is currently in the process of changing their constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman.
there is no evidence indicating that the children of lesbian and gay parents are less well adjusted than children of heterosexual parents.

Because in a way demisexuals can be ""allo-passing"" when in a relationship (read: can experience sexual attraction), some full-ace people see that as not truly the same struggle or truly knowing what it's like to be full-ace.

Even though I'm okay with being a guy I'd be really sad now that's dysphoria in many aspects but that alone being a preference is pretty much dysphoria in itself, it may not be as big as other forms but preferring in my eyes is dysphoric in a way, does that make sense?"

Counterpoint: almost no one is actually afraid of being labelled as transphobic. Transphobia is an incredibly common prejudice which carries little to no consequences - which is how this article and headline got published in first place  URL
I second that. I have super awesome cis friends who managed to grow past a lot of their heterosexual masculine upbringing but they seem to be rare gems. And they still struggle with some things that I just never had to learn and unlearn.
The fact that your money is going to oppress gay people and oppose access to birth control
You're asexual because no woman would drop her standards so low. Fuck off you loser.

"Sometimes you have to be disobedient to best honor your family. See Mulan.  For just one example, any Methodist church I've walked into has been boldly welcoming to and accepting of LGBTQ people, just as Jesus was. I know Baptists wouldn't do this due to the ""disobedience"" factor."
I don't benefit financially from saying there are or aren't diversity issues.

There's a lot wrong here and I'm not sure where to start.  I guess let's just get the definition of gender right and go from there. You seem to have mixed sexual orientation into gender—which is incorrect.  Gender is just the expressed sex identity. It's what social norms for a sex you express. It has nothing to do with your sexual orientation or preferences in a mate.

I think they're 2 totally different things. From what I understand Incels are usually virgins that want more than anything to get laid and have a relationship with a woman. Their hatred comes from the pain of constant rejection. The MGTOW guys are basically done with women by choice because of their personal experiences. There's a lot of guys that lost their ass in horrible divorces that join the MGTOW.

"You did experience the same thing as me. Might not be ""same sex"" stuff, but the shame and guilt Christianity places on the natural human desires to be loved and connected to others in terms of relationships and sex is very universal regardless of the gender of the person you desire those things with. I've been on both sides of the ""straight"" and ""gay"" guilt. Both suck pretty equally lol.  And thanks for the encouragement. Being more patient with myself is good advice. I wake up everyday and think ""why am I not fixed yet"" but like you said, it takes time."
"I'm horrified to hear that.  I just made a video about the gay community and my thoughts on it. We've all been through the pain of coming out. We've all been through the fear of having that close call and being tested and afraid.  So instead of hate why don't we support each other through our shared experiences and hardships that we all have in common!?  I just don't understand why we don't band together and support one another instead of this bizarre gay community we have at the moment which is all about tribes and socks and superficial, irrelevant BS."

"As someone who has been in denial for 15+ years and has awful gender dysphoria every day, I think it's important that (even if I do transition) I talk about the injustices that I face because of the fact that I am born and raised female. It is upsetting and hurts to talk about but it cannot be ignored.  It seems lke people pay more attention to trans women because it is more revolutionary for a MtF to transition than a FtM because they are doing what patriarchal society is telling them NOT to do: to reject masculinity in favor of femininity."
The problem with the 1st is that the girls are hella sexist 😑

I have been afraid to come out, but when I learned what my situation was called and that there are more people like me I was trilled. I can still fall in love with men and still get married. So happy, thank you for the video, it gave me courage. Hello to all the Try Guys. 💜🖤💜🦄"
Oh reread your post and actually your question is not that deep..! No I think how people identify is personal to them and finding a partner that loves you is a separate issue. Being a fem man is not at all being a trans woman.  If this isn't your own set of worries maybe you shouldn't concern yourself too much with it!
"Your point is both very valid and completely void in my mind.  I understand why people might think this way, but in my mind it's really backwards considering the fact that both men and women should be equal in a modern society.    It's not that women should have better rights for a time to make up for lost rights historically, it's more that we should just work towards a point where everyone is just judged on their own merits.  Doesn't really matter if you are male or female in my mind, some people do some things better than others, regardless of the genitals."
"Yep, very sad. This is the perfect example of how pieces of shit like this are normalizing hate. They want to make it acceptable to call people queers and other slurs.

I hate how news media titles subjects so negatively. I am with @MarioLopezExtra kids should just be kids. I don't think kids are old enough to know what they really want or know anything about sexuality yet. If you change something physically that can be dangerous.

"I just see a growing trend with people feeling ""not trans enough"" if they don't get the surgery. Or people hyping it like it isn't a big deal and ""you'll feel so much better afterwards""/""I don't even have dysphoria anymore"". I know that there are many ways to transition and that it's basically it's own spectrum, and many people know they never want the surgery. But, it's becoming less acceptable to even have a conversation about it. When we can't even talk about it anymore then lots of people are going to slip through the cracks, which is happening already."

There are biologically two genders irrespective of what people identify as. Sometimes nature goes a little of course but even so those people are still made up of male and female parts. How many genders people identify as is irrelevant to the fact that factually there's only two genders.

"Good and deep response, especially the end of it. I like how you see it now. You should definitely do what will you make happy. Doesn't matter what other people say. And if you can find peace with yourself without medical intervations, then it is probably the best solution.  Btw in my case my gender issues started when I was around 12 and very slowly progressed to the point if no return. But it wasn't caused by evaluation of societal advantages, rather with sexual identity feelings. I was crossdressing and secretly wished I was female for 18 years."

That is the world. We are addicted to sex. The middle east tries to control it by forcing humility on the women in their dress and behavior. Other cultures like France embrace it. The US also embraces it but tries to pretend they dont.

I absolutely adore this art piece yet because of a few comments I saw here I feel the need to note that sexuality and not confirming gender roles/self-expression is not to be confused.
"Yeah I think allowing myself to be very gender-nonconforming was really important in accepting that I'm trans - not only because I got used to dressing masc and essentially looking like a very non-passing trans guy / super butch before I even realized, but also because I got used to people giving me dirty looks. Now it's something I almost take pride in."

"I consider it a health condition, which has my sympathy. I can't imagine what it would be like to wish more than anything to be born the opposite sex. That has to be difficult, even though it's not in itself life threatening like cancer or a disability like blindness.

"I'm 41. A few years ago it started to dawn on me that (1) I might be hating sexism and gender roles not only bc I was a woman (I'm AFAB), but also because I was *not* a woman, and (2) that I've never really had a feeling of my own gender inside me, just things about how I choose to present myself, or how people react to me. I currently identify as an agender woman, within the umbrella of nonbinary. My partner and some of my friends know, but not all of them and not my coworkers or clients. I still pass as a cis woman on most days, so I treat that as my uniform at work, and I get by."

I understood your point and thank you for making it. Part of why as a younger man I felt i couldn't be a dad is becsue it didn't happen nuch at all 15-20 years ago so growing up a family was one man one women. Adoption was done by straight couples who couldn't or didnt want to conceive natuaky. Gay people were never ralked avout as wanting to build families even fron within the comunity. Hopefully my children's generation will be able to see same sex adoption in exactly the same way as straight adoption but for my generation that's not possible.

To be more clear, I consider sexual orientation and therefor the sex of your romantic partners to be completely trivial matters in the eyes of (a normal) society, meaning that we should accept is as is and not make a fuss about it. To be even more clear, that's in the eyes of a society, for an individual that is of course a big deal in life.. What matters is that there is love and that the people are good and kind, with whom matters not."

Life isn't black and white, and you don't need to be so worried and consumed with the grey areas. Just work on being the best you possible and accepting yourself for who you are."
"I used to feel that way too. Then I went super girly (make up and dresses etc) for a bit and felt better (and then I went back to my tomboy ways because while I don't identify as a man, I'm not femme). Oddly I get misgendered less when I have short hair versus long hair."

"I don't think you understood what I said, I am ok with NI actresses playing SI women, I am not ok with them playing NI characters because that's appropriation of achievements that belong to SI women, hope you understand the difference.

"Fantastic. Now, as a man, I'm going to now say I'm a woman.

"I just get frustrated with this thread, seeing that the only correct answer is at the bottom while a bunch of incorrect ones gets upvoted. Sexuality isn't something you change, if you have bi-tendencies you've always had them but porn might have made you discover them. Sexuality is a spectrum, you can still be mostly straight with a preference for the opposite gender, but have a small in comparison preference for the same gender. Sexuality isn't something anyone should be ashamed, it isn't something you can force change on, and spreading those misconceptions about it is dangerous"
"While I disagree with your take on brown/blackface, i appreciate that you make the effort to be sensitive to the minorities.

"Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more ""equality"", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.).

"It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if ""being white"" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts."
"It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change."
">Some incels give a lot but get nothing back   And so should be rewarded with pussy?

How committed are you to the belief that women are holes, rather than human beings deserving of respect?"

"If my partner came out to me as trans, I would love snd support them, I might even try to stay, but I don't know if I could because, well, a lot of trans people go sort of crazy for a bit. Given the situation, this is actually quite reasonable, as they're trying to relearn about themselves and their bodies, there's often a lot of bew hormones and everything, plus all the every day life style changes. The person who begins that journey is often not the person who finishes it, which is fine and, again, quite understandable."

"I feel this so hard. Cis folks seem to have this weird idea that being trans is all suffering and hating ourselves, but things tend to get better for us when we come out, not worse. The isolation and misery is usually related to trying to live the way they expect us to.  My happiness, relationship health, and overall well-being improved drastically when I came out and keeps getting better every day."
"""You will always be my son,"" is exactly how my mother would handle it. She said ""You will always be Catholic,"" when I converted to Judaism.  My advice is this: Don't struggle to gain acceptance from family members. You are an adult (or will be one someday) and the only person that truly matters is YOU. When you worry, get frustrated, and even change plans because of anyone, you are giving that person, or group of people too much power. Be yourself and you'll be a much happier, healthier person."
That's it? You women getting strict URL
That makes a lot of sense. When I first realized I was bi the big trans wasn't far behind. Not seeing myself as a heterosexual man helped pave the way to me not seeing myself as a man at all. I hadn't considered the intersection of other minority groups but it really does seem pretty logical. Thanks for the insight.

"Does my life from 18 to 32 count as a moment? Seriously though, the earliest moment for me was seeing a queer show in college at 18. Drag queens, kings, trans men and women, non-binary and varying types of queer; doing stage performances, lip syncing, etc. This was the first time I saw a trans woman in person, and all I could think was ""I wish I could be her."""
"I think all transgender people don't want to be ""trans"", they want to be just ""male""/""man"" or ""female""/""woman"".  Hard part is that with changes, we directly change sexual interactions. Partner may expect something from sexual relationships, so that's main reason it's not good to fully be closed (at least with those with whom you considering serious relationships). So, yes. I will never be ""true"" woman. Never will experience menstruation, pregnancy. It's hurt. I wish people just accept me with my gender like any other person with traditional gender - don't bother, don't ""see"" it, see just me."
Love a woman with a smile  Especially dirty minded wife
She looks like the kind of girl who hangs out at the bus stop with a girl friend looking for people to beat up. Like she is the one that holds their arms and has her slightly fatter and slightly sluttier friend punch them in the stomach.
It's hard to predict how people will react to their significant other cross dressing. Tolerance doesn't always equal unconditional acceptance and I'm sorry that you had to discover that the hard way. You have been open and honest about your desire to express your feminine side. I think it's time for your partner to share her feelings about your cross dressing and tell you what she can and can't live with.  She might not give you the answer you want to hear but at least you'll know where she stands. I hope it works out for you 💞
"You do what you feel is right, the truth has always been multidimensional and the real truth lies in making yourself happy. I dont care if someone has a sex change to make them happy. At least she is alive and happy. Only the person living a identity knows what they are going through. People can have past life memories, I don't know what it is but there cannot be so many people with similar views to life."

we live in a society where so many people tell us we're delusional for being trans. I have a supportive family and even they say that I should really question myself whether I want to transition. we're being made unsure at every turn. it's not your fault you have doubts.

Good grief your gf and my stories are the exact same. Minus the enby for me. Been on hrt for 13 months and small changes but I NEVER get gendered female. And I'm all tomboy/punk so tons of basketball shorts and band T-shirts in my wardrobe. And never getting gendered correctly really bothers me but I also don't always want to glam it up just so people can stare and misgender me anyway.

Trans women aren't men tho? They have less testosterone than cis women. You have to be on HRT for like 2 years to compete as a trans woman in most sports. Why are you arguing about this when you don't even know the very basics of how any of this world?

I just want to clear up that I didn't think about anyone other than myself and my personal problems when writing this - I fully appreciate anyone who is happy with being female and I'm proud of you as well. I'm also happy with it sometimes. That up there is my evil inner voice speaking and I don't like to listen."
I do think in my opinion there is problems with the equality act in that it takes an all or nothing approach. Like we need the equality act but I as a trans woman I Don't think I belong in every woman's space especially prior to transitioning. If you don't take hrt but identify as trans that's fine but I don't think competing with biological woman should be allowed in sports. I think there's a compromise here somewhere.
oh ok! I thought we were talking about a trans woman.
I want to ram my cock down her throat
Honestly i was very much transphobic and just otherwise bigoted for almost all of 2016 because i got scared of questioning my gender and it took until earlier this year to realize im a girl. I think a lot of trans people are in the same boat as u and its healthy to acknowledge this

Transwomen retain male privilege on grounds of not having been socialized as women. They were raised as agressors and that behavior continues after transition. Transmen are generally not really included by the TRAA because they are considered women and not men.

I suppose it'd be like if everyone in the world started calling me a woman. I know I'm not, and I've never felt that way, but it would be really hard to explain that feeling to people."

"Your first step in all of this is to talk with a therapist (and with a transgender support group, if possible) , which has absolutely no negative consequences. Get on those as soon as you can.

You have no obligation to make a decision either way beyond the obligation to live your life as best as you possibly can."

Why are you generalizing and stereotyping all trans based off the ones your socialized with? 2019 and trans people are stereotyping other trans. Crazy.

Do you know the years of counseling that they go through trying to figure out who they are? The years of depression? Attempted suicides because of the mental illness associated with it? The distress it causes the families knowing how hard it is for their child growing up being so confused? Some might say, it would be easier if they'd never been born at all. Abortion is the choice of the parents and they need to be able to decide based on the quality of life of their child."

I always keep going for the person in me that wants to live. Some other details: I am transgender (ftm), which makes it a lot easier for me to disassociate from my younger self and see her as a different person. I like to see her as my own child in a way; as someone I have to take care of."
"@erejnion @_Zeria_ As humans, it is inevitable that we will change the more we grow, and as we grow we build our identity, and I believe she meant that the same goes for gender.

"He may be right, but it's got nothing to do with Trump. It's because trannies engage in lifestyle choices that are extremely high risk. They are frequent drug users, and they often engage in (highly lucrative) specialty prostitution.

YES I GET TO BE TRANS JINN This is my transition goals
It's still heterosexuality though? Also something something I'm pretty sure. calling someone a rapist is against the sub rules but what do I know. Very sensible and sensitive thing to say to someone who for all you know could have been a rape survivor - seeing as trans teens have about double the risk of rape or forced sex or sexual violence in high school than cis girls...
"Local LGBT groups will probably have the best info about what coming out in your area is like and where to get more support. For example, I live on the east edge of Iowa(kind of Iowa's east coast) which trends more supportive than the deeper red western Iowa. I don't know what Utah is like for trans people( I hear more from atheists trying to navigate Mormon dominated areas). General advise is strength in numbers, avoid situations where likely transphobes have it and find numbers to help you."
"I'm trying not to be Fucking Pissed & be Proud but folks. Its hard. Stop using us, start supporting us. (And fellow LGBTQA+ folks. I'm looking at you too, everyone who feels queer no matter what letter they identify as they belongs at pride. Period.)"
"My life has improved dramatically since I first came out when I was 15. Being able to take control of my life and transition both socially and physically has been amazing. What most people don't know is that when you are trans you don't just come out once. There's coming out to your family, your friends, at school, at work. It never actually ends. Every new person you meet is someone that you might come out to. You also have to decide if you want to come out to someone. You don't have to. It might be unsafe to. It might work out wonderfully and you'll gain a new ally."
"I like the idea of ""believing in"" gay marriage."
I guess if you call me transphobic enough it makes you right. Then you don't have to consider everything I pointed out about your bullshit arguments. Convenient.
"Your previous statement, ""Men aren't women,"" doesn't even do anything to address the issue of trans identity. Saying A≠B has no bearing on how a or be can be defined independently, it merely states that they are different categories which is an empty truism which illuminates nothing in this context. These sorts of issues cannot be proven in any absolute sense but nothing you say has even gestured toward the appearance of a proof."
"Also Shinto culture, especially when it comes to the deity Inari Okami, tends to be quite androgynous and accepting of trans people. I myself am a follower of Inari because of how accepting the beliefs are."
"Am cis not trans, but just wanted to offer some hope to you. A friend of mine came out to her wife a couple of years ago. At the time, apart from the kids part, the wife had the same view. It was touch and go for a while, she really felt it was a dealbreaker. After some therapy and much soul-searching she realised she fell in love with the same person and she didn't want to be with anyone else. They are still together, happy and making it work. :)"
"Hello. It was strange because being trans went hand in hand with that, but watching the power rangers movie and seeing Kimberely the pink power ranger, my gosh. I wanted to be her and be with her."
"That makes sense tbh, I do already feel somewhat more connected and decent in myself just by letting the truth out. My mum was the same... she said she'd rather id just come out as gay in the first place aha my dad too but yeah wasn't quite that simple.

"Among people my age lgbt is pretty much just a meme. There are lots of gay/lesbian/bi people who are totally normal and they are always accepted, even by the religious kids. But the ones who obnoxiously fit all the lgbt stereotypes are literally considered a fucking joke. Personally I have no problem with anybody like that until their actions start to affect my life."

"Look, I understand and empathize with your position. But there have been people working with the trans community for decades on this issue. Working to help them to the best of their ability, to help them lead happy and healthy lives. And the current way things are done is the result of those years of efforts. The medical community that has sprung up around this topic are *on it*. We are not at the stage of treating trans people where wild ideas that people just thought up out of the blue, we're at the ""its been decades and we have a good idea oh how to help."""

"Hey guys you are younger me. Well kinda. There's no exact science to the queer spectrum. Let's just say at 30 I really seriously looked at my non-conforming side. Coming out would have destroyed my marriage and social network.  I'm not satisfied with erotic fantasies any longer, as I explore their root, I realize I'd be.... maybe not happy, but I'd be more comfortable in my skin. Pick your moment. Don't feel pressured, you can have a closeted life if you prefer. I would definitely stop short of marrying someone, if you know then you should tell them. Even if you love them. That won't be enough."
"Kuwait sounds like it needs to move forward on women's rights but then again, most of the world does. If you choose to study abroad, I'd suggest Canada. I live in Victoria BC, it's very LGBT friendly and lots of great people here. Vancouver too is very good. If you did choose to, my partner and I would be happy to help with any questions or showing you around etc. Good luck, be safe, here's to building a better world where everyone is safe and cared for."

"Add another to the minority. ;-) I'd say yes, CD people can be under the transgender umbrella. I say that as people can struggle with their gender and just because we're not 'dressed up', it didn't mean the feelings around gender - and how it doesn't quite feel right - go away. I'd rather have an umbrella term - like Trans (or transgender) - that can include all of us. I think there are so many outside the community who want to push us back into the shadows or drive us apart."
"Definitely in the same situation for all 3, thanks for letting me know that there's someone out there who feels the same way. Super religious parents, mom blames herself for me being transgender and tells me I have these thoughts because I don't go to church often. Guess what mom? I went to church the past few weeks and I still feel shitty! Sorry for the mini-rant."
"I also wish transfolk all the best and hope they find peace.  I do think there are some concerning elements, like this yaniv chick, and people shouldn't be afraid to criticize her or to ask questions about some of what's going on in the trans community.

"The only issue I have, which isn't really an issue just an observation and opinion, is the rights that gays/bis fight for are completely different for what trans fight for. Sexual Attraction and self identity are so different. One wants their marriage, adoption etc recognized. The other wants their gender and name recognized. I completely support trans people and their right to be themselves. But it doesn't go hand in hand with what gays are fighting for. Otherwise we'd have just one big civil rights group combined with race, age, handicaps, etc"
"Before I joined the church I had absolutely no problem with them and wanted to them to have marriage equality and everything. Now, I'm not really sure what my stance is to be honest. I'm still trying to align my personal beliefs with the church's beliefs. I mostly feel the same about LGBT as I did before I joined the church, but realise my church beliefs don't match up with that. I try to recognise that I don't know or understand everything about the world or the church, and just trust in my testimony of the church."

"@nbs8989 WTF is happening to society where people think it's normal for anyone, let alone a juvenile, to mutilate their sexual organs based on emotion?"
So sad. Mercedes was finally being who she truly was and was finally fully happy and her life was cut short. Her family except her dad were supportive and loved her no matter what and I'm glad the majority did. It's so hard to come out as being a different sex to the one you were born and so many people are still closed minded about all of this xxx
I'm sorry that's been your experience.. I am queer and have kinks and have had many great and positive conversations with people about sexuality. It's a fascinating subject.
Its almost like dysphoria is not the only reason this happens. Maybe the constant harassment and violence from people with similar beliefs to your own might have a little something to do with it? You fucking peon.
Transitioning genders isn't anything like getting a tattoo. They're so different on so many levels.

"Come on, you forgot us over at /r/COMPLETEANARCHY, we love and support all trans folks and think you all are scum that deny science"
I feel like this was so poorly worded but TL;dr I'm trying to be optimistic in that this is a good thing in the long run for who transfolk are viewed in society. However I agree that we shouldn't celebrate or cheer Victoria Secret's for this.
"I definitely did. When I first came out, I wanted to avoid the label ""trans"" because literally the only thing I knew about trans people was that life is kinda hard for them, so my friend suggested that I might just be genderfluid instead. And I used that label for a solid year or so before I discovered I'm actually more binary than I thought. It's still a wonderful identity, and it sparked a lot of the critical thinking I did about gender through my transition."
Well what if Values change? What if in ten years transgenderism or god forbid pedophilia is considered a morally acceptable act? Will enough people be morally disgusted by such things being included in what many Americans have always considered to be the moral torchcarrier of America?

So now I'm a lesbian? No, I figured out, I'm bisexual.  Later on, figured out I was male. That made way more sense. Am I still bisexual, I asked myself.

"i am a trans man who doesn't feel dysphoric at the thought of giving birth either and i am not super young so that's the reason why i haven't gotten on t yet, i'm afraid of taking that possibility away from myself (i've always known i was nb but i realized i was trans only about a year ago). i was raised by my father and my mother is non-binary and very masculine so i never associated giving birth and raising a child with femininity. so yeah i'm here to say that you're valid and you should go for it if this is what you want!"

NTA. You're being required to be in this homophobic environment all the time. You should do whatever you feel you have to do to protect yourself and get through it.
Youre absolutely right. I actually have a confession to make: nothing gets me more aroused than watching gavin mcinnes stick that dildo up his butt. Wanna get together and jerk each other off while we watch it on repeat?
I accept you for who you are and I could care less if you are gay cuz I'm bisexual. I was made fun of it and my parents didn't accept me for some time but I didn't let that affect me in any way. I may not be perfect but I still love myself for who I am and you should too♥️🧡💛💚💙💜
Apparently bi men can't either
We should rather see what the LGBTQ+ community did in India. They were an organic movement. They were also successfull.
Try to find a local LGBTQ support groups that provide a safe space for youth. PFLAG sometimes provides that space. Gay Straight Alliances also provide space in some schools. Even just finding one person who is an ally would be a big help. You are valid.
My wife is bi. We had another couple we did this with. Basically my wife and the other couple had a threesome then a week later it was me my wife and the women from the couple. Everyone enjoyed themselves a lot but we talk a lot about boundries and other things leading up to it. It did help that my wife and the other women are both bi tho
That is a homophobic slur!
"I've only recently come out as bi. Some women are totally not cool with it, some think it's sexy as hell and others are just supportive.

Ive Decided im not going to come out as bi to my family and friends  My entire life my family made it clearly they didn't want me to have any relationships with men and it's even worse because I actually get along really well with them both i love them with all my heart and I know they love me (as bizarre as that may sound)  I know there are so many people out suffering from way worse than myself but I still felt like if i came out things would change and everyone would see me differently and I don't need that in my life
So is homosexuality. So is being transgender. So is not being white. The world is leaving you and your bigotry behind. I hope for your kids' sake that they can catch up despite your bad parenting.

"Off topic of OP's post, but I'm so happy to hear of someone like me! I was lesbian for a long time, thankfully now more bi, but I have never acted on those feelings. I have a wonderful boyfriend, and I manage to love him even though my body still tries to pull me to women sometimes. Most Christians I know say that's insane, I'm homophobic for resisting those urges, god says all love is good, etc, but I know it's immoral and I am feeling lust, not love.

"IDK, you do have some valid points but as far as I'm concerned, pride is essentially for the sexuality/gender minority- folk who are not straight. I kinda think aces should be a part of it- maybe they aren't as discriminated against, and maybe it isn't such an unusuality as the other sexualities or whatever, but still! That's just my opinion though, and I'd say I'm fairly biased anyways."

I'm Bi too and I live in a very accepting household and even I am scared of coming out. Good job for doing it and good luck!

"I support their freedom to love who they want to love. Different minority and/or disadvantaged groups including my own have burnt me out on social justice, though.

You are valid, you are loved, you matter. ❤️💜💙"
High-five bi brother. Indeed it does rule
It's okay to be lesbian.  It's okay to be straight.  It's okay to be gay.  It's okay to be bi. It's okay to be trans.  It's okay to be you. But it's NEVER okay to use sound or drop on lured Cogs. 😤😤😤

I believe it. Even when I was in the closet my macho straight besties either tried to arrange 3-ways with me or else I found bi porn in their collections.

I'm sorry it went like that with your grandma, but so glad your parents are supportive of you; I'm sure it was a really scary to come out to your family, and you are so very brave to do so.

I know they'll be accepting but I just haven't felt the need to tell them. And funny story, it turns out the other friend is bi or at least somewhere towards the middle of the Kinsey scale. So I guess LGBT magnetism is a real thing?"

"on the one hand. I'm sorry. i think most people in the LGTB spectrum have had that overwhelming sensation of 'shit this is hard,' at multiple points. It really can be difficult to leave normative societal rules. However, on the other side of things, it might take some time but you're going to find a great pool of people to date and hang out with and just connect to. And when it does it'll be totally worth it. We don't call ourselves a community for nothing. Till then though, wishing you all the strength and some absolutely devastating ladies sometime soon"
"Yeah, if your therapist recommended it, I would absolutely try it out. If it's too awkward, maybe find a different one. The LGBTQ center closest to me has a number of groups tailored to specific age groups and stages of transition. My anxiety around it is if I go, then it makes this all real. But all I want right now is a safe space where someone will call me by my chosen name, so I guess it already is."
"28 yo, realized I was bi during my teens. It took a dime plus change to actually leave the closet. Not everyone who ought to know knows yet but it won't stay that way for long. It was easy to hide that side of myself when there was no one else involved but that's changed, and I'm not one to hide my relationships away from anyone."

Yo happy pride month to all of the LGBTQ+ people out there! While probably not one myself I support the cause and wanted to let you all know I think you're awesome!!
"I'm bi, too. I finally accepted it in high school, which was in a tiny bible-belt town in the Appalachian mountains. Not many progressives in the region. Coming out was such a liberating experience and effected me way more than I thought it would (in a good way!). That being said, be safe and be smart. LGBTQ prejudice is alive and well, and it would be smart to carefully consider who to come out to and when. Look into resources like The Trevor Project, It Gets Better, etc. You're not alone!"
"Connecticut bi woman here, just know you aren't alone and we all love and accept you."
i'm so in the middle between pan and bi and so i really could've identified as either and it wouldn't matter but i chose bi cause the flag is pretty.
@ChriSm1th @dominicmalmonte Like homosexuality was ever directly connected to incest
YES! Thank you for mentioning it. It means very much to a lot of us.  I'm thinking this is especially important in a lot of countries where LGBTI people still face lots of discrimination and where probably most LGBTI trainers are in the closet.
or go to the rural villages and you will hear christians advocate beating of gays.or call gay people vermin. Sure some places in the midlle east are fucked and conservative as shit. however that restrictive control is exactly what the muslims are fleeing.
"NTA. You don't need to want to go to Pride if you don't want to, but it still has a vital place in our community. As for the less conventional parts of the Pride parades, the majority of the BDSM and kink community have always stood up for us. Even if there weren't overlaps between queer people and being open to more creative types of sex, that community has always stood by us, like the furry community has, so they deserve to walk amongst our allies"
Fuck y'all pussies then die slow
It's confusing but still empowering. I'm 19 and starting to realize I've always liked guys even though I've always identified as very straight. This is essentially my second time coming out after telling my girlfriend. She's actually pretty excited because she's pansexual so we can connect over both being queer.

This is me in a nutshell. And I've rolled the thought over in my mind so many times. Am I bi? Am I bi? Am I bi?  I've learned that bisexuality is a spectrum. It can come in many different forms and it doesn't always mean that you want to have sex and date both genders equally. It can be just as you've described it. You're welcome to message me if you wanna chat with someone who feels the same :)
@chief_tyrol Well I think what people want from the term pan is a more exact definition of who they are attracted to (which is all). It allows for less confusion when saying who they are attracted too. Whereas a bisexual person could be attracted to a vast amount of gender combinations and

"I'm living somewhat in the middle of those two cultures. What I mean is, I'm from Czechia, Poland's neighbor, and due to the immense secularization process my country underwent during the last 100 years, especially during the 40-year communist regime, our country cannot be considered Catholic (though it is the biggest religion here). I feel for the Polish people but I cannot get behind attacking people on the street solely because of their LGBT convictions and I find such extremes are becoming too common in Catholic societies."

"You might not feel like it yet, but you are in the community and you will be welcomed in it. Doesn't matter if you came out at age 7 or at age 87, or if you haven't come out at all. It just takes a little time to feel that way because you are used to seeing this as an outside group and not as part of your community. But the LGBTQ community will welcome you with open arms when you're ready"
"When I married my husband I was like ""yep, team heterosexual now"". It took me a couple of years into my marriage to realise I'm still a part of the LGBT community.

Just know that these feelings are 100% extremely common in bi people. I can relate to all this. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to let these feelings get to you too much.

Went to my first pride this year but left my straight boyfriend at home and went with some other queer friends. There were actually so many bi pride flags that I'm bringing him next year 😊
"As a fellow big-tiddied woman, and as a bisexual, I can assure you. It's fucking great."
I'm so into others girls but I'm really infatuated with myself
"I definitely agree with this, I am a Bi girl who has a for sure preference for girls. However, it's very hard for me to find other queer girls that I'm interested in, but I have found myself being hit on by guys frequently which would give me the option to date them (If I wanted to.)"
First I'd slide down your knicker so so slow get some lube place it in and round your asshole put some on my cock and slowly push my cock up your asshole 🤤🤤🤤🤤
"Yo, I'm not an ace, but y'all are totally welcome in the LGBTQ+ community and spaces. I don't experience asexuality, but if people being sexually attracted to just 1 sex and/or gender is real, then having no sexual attraction is real too. Stay blessed, everyone! 🖤🔘⚪️💜 (that's my attempt to use emojis for an ace flag)"
Me when my family confronts me about all the queer content on my social media URL
"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the company of men very much. I just want to be able to take advantage of my Bisexuality and have sex with both men and women. And it frustrates me that I can't. I believe I would be equally as frustrated if it were the other way around. Where I would have success with women but none with men. My frustration isn't that I end up sleeping with men necessarily, but that I'm not successful with women and the only options I can think of is to pay for it but I'm too broke for that."

"You've caught the big gay, it's known to be airborne via dildos."
Always listened to me. Always took the time ti make me understand when I did something wrong. Always believed in me. Loved me unconditionally. Mom was a bit homophobic (which is common for people of her background). In 2017 I came out as bi and I didn't know how she would handle it. She hugged me and said nothing could ever change her love for me. She's since met my girlfriend. She now also talks to me about how the LGBT+ community deserve to be treated wiyh respect. She has literally always been the best person in my life.

"Yes! Incredibly difficult. Most of the time, I have no idea if they are queer so I'm just super nice/polite/protective and I think they just assume I'm friendly cuz I present femme. I would try to come out to them myself, but I'm from a small community and that's risky. ><  Also, I'm way more awkward around girls...like I know the script for guys, I know what the media says is ""sexy"" and I know what has worked in the past. For girls I just have no idea. 😭"

">Besides, companies trying to keep on top of diversity isn't necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. Non-whites, women and sexual minorities are underrepresented in just about every industry in the first world and not by coincidence, hiring biases exist and due to lack of opportunities it's tougher to break in for those with biases against them. Plus different backgrounds add different experience and ideas to the company, so it's healthy for them too. Forced representation still isn't the solution. There should be equality of opportunity, not of outcome."

It's like you don't know what the words you're using mean. Enforcing bisexuality (attraction to both men and women) is oppressive. Just as it would be to enforce heterosexuality or homosexuality. Quite clearly nothing has been 'revealed' to you. It must be exhausting living in your head.

This is no different than voting a straight party ticket or letting your union tell you who to vote for. I have no problems voting for a woman and I like Warren quite a bit but I don't like her cause she is a woman. I didn't vote for Obama because he was black nor did I vote for Clinton because he was white. We should each and every one of us vote for the candidate that we feel is best suited to do the job regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation."
I agree with you but supporting the LGBT+ community as a straight person in Hip-hop is big and kind of paves the way for others to come out or express their support for the community.
Happy #pridemonth. A necessary reminder for all allies to continually and consistently stand against bigotry and in solidarity with the #lgbt+ community URL
❤️ for sure! Feels awful to think of people discriminating against me just for my sexual orientation. Happy to help y'all in any way I can :)

Wonderful Fabulous News!!! Gay Marriage Pride dears!
it's almost pride month so have a very cute bi pride boyo URL
My first few lgbt friends outside of college I met when I used to volunteer at the lgbt center here. But yeah it's tough as fuck in general making new friends when you're older. I consider everyone who has a sold group of close friends they've known for forever incredibly lucky. Most of my friendships have happened in phases. Including the lgbt friends.
"I think I always knew I was attracted to women but it's often so hard to tell with bisexuality. Like once I realized that straight people don't feel attraction the same way I was like ""oh well i guess I'm bi"" but that didn't happen until I was 17. Now I look back on the earlier parts of my life and wonder how it wasn't more obvious"
Looks like a catholic priest to me. Fuckers are disgusting

It's a simple question, is Tulsi's religion homophobic? We know her father was virulently homophobic as was she. Does she now support gay rights e.g. the recent equality act, even if her religion is against it (like a Catholic candidate)?"
"That was the most beautiful coming out video, I almost cried. The talent Eugene holds is unbelievable, and I am incredibly proud of his courage.

(I'm Muslim, and not quite sure how to take the lgbtq+ community, but I will NEVER do anything to take action against them. I will love anyone, regardless of who they are and how they classify themselves. We are all humans, and all deserve to be treated like such. That's what I believe the word of God is.)"

are you cherry emoji twitter or are you bisexual
"So I'm bi but I feel this subreddit is still somewhat relevant to me, but heres my thoughts.  I myself wear band tees and other stuff that isnt the usual LGBT associated attire, sometimes I do but not often. But I've hardly ever had issues out at gay bars or with my gay friends.   Some have asked why but most people dont really care I think. But you'll always have haters no matter how you dress. Just do you and dress how you want, not for others approval"
Dude same I didn't even know being bi was a thing. Life has made so much more sense ever since lol
PSA: if you're bisexual in a hetro relationship you still get to celebrate pride and be proud of who you are🤗🌈
So youre not really anti lgbt?
"No, this is a celebration of us getting married this Reddit is for bisexual people so I am celebrating it with other bi people. You don't need to get it."
"Thanks for the info. Apparently, girl-girl relationships are legal in Jamaica but I don't think that's enough to say everything is fine and dandy there.

+Carlos Ramirez saying what ?? What were you trying to say?? Cause right now you sound like a homophobic
@vulpixed @zoe_trashgoblin @traineryelIow im a lesbian and i can be attracted to men sometimes. demanding that we adhere to labels and their bounds rigidly is literally the opposite of queer liberation. the labels serve our expression. we do not conform our expression to the prescription of the labels
"I love this and I'm so happy for you and your partner! My boyfriend and I are both bi, so we can exist on the street as long as we don't mention our attraction to the ""other"" gender (not really other bc there are a million genders but that's how homophobes usually see it)"
How fags cock looks while riding a dildo URL
"High five on that! I totally lose my mind around attractive women. I'm in a relationship with a man, and I love him, but I'm bi, so I get to do this whole awkward thing with multiple genders."
"awkwardness, people calling each other fags if you turned to talk while changing. There is also the occasional ass beating or for some reason, teabagging."
This video just goes out to show the respect for LGBT COMMUNITY!
"Good luck hun, from one bisexual to another ❤️"
Yeah no homophobic in that at all. You're quoting Bubba The Love Sponge? I remember when Bubba won the Nobel ... no wait ... the Pulitiz ... no wait ... it's Bubba The Fucking Love Sponge. Jesus A Christ that is literally the best you have? I'm no fan of Tucker. In fact I've given up Fox News because like CNN and MSNBC it's just a team. I refuse teams. Just keep screaming white nationalism because at this point thoughtful people just shake their heads at that shit.
"i feel this so heavily. i wish i could help. but im mostly closeted. so what can i do. im stuck all the same. i recommend trevorspace as a website with accepting and helpful people for LGBTQ, but i don't know what else to do. good luck."
"Honestly I understand the reason for it. I don't think the LGBTQ community is oppressed, but it wasn't that long ago that they were. While they aren't oppressed by our government, many in the community (especially teens) often aren't accepted by their families and are often disowned and abused. Pride month is a way of acknowledging the progress that's been made and supporting those in the community that are still vulnerable. I don't understand why people can't simply ignore it if they don't want to be involved instead of being actively against it. They aren't hurting anyone."
"Having come out as gay and then later come out as trans, I think we're about 20 years behind. It's not great, but it's definitely workable. I live in Los Angeles, and most people here don't care.  If it helps, I was very scared too, and my fears were out of proportion with the actual reactions I've had."
@JKCorden And yet some people still don't feel that educating young people about the LGBT community is important 😡😡
Pride month? Pride in what? There is nothing pride-worthy in just being attracted differently.

@ReginaldALawso1 He is absolutely disgusting. This can only be attention seeking and an insult to the LGBT Community
You're a grown-ass adult who uses homophobic slurs and tells people to kill themselves apparently so idk man.
I'm so disappointed. A teacher said to me that a lgbt community is breaking human psyche.
Love how men will slag off other men saying their pest and leeches.. when their the exact same..  Sending dick pics and dirty messages..  Hate fake people me.
"Same. I'm 27 and only this year realized I'm a lesbian, after years thinking I was bi, making excuses to not date men, and trying explain why I don't want to be with men, well, turns out it's because I'm a lesbian that never really questioned my lack of attraction to men. Ahh, feels good, like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders!"
The sexy kind and the slutty kind.
"This really really hit home for me today, as i am a bisexual male in a heterosexual relationship with a unaccepting spouse. Its been a rough day mentally as i also went to my first pride event ever, i probably shouldnt have gone alone, but i did and ended up leaving feeling even more alone. Being a bi man is not easy at times, but it is who i am"
THEY CAN BE WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BE IF I WAS A BOY I WOULD BE GAY AND I WOUKD STATE IT OUT TO EVERYONE  I'm bi and I'm scared to come out to my parents
"Yeah there's always gonna be some level of unknown and otherness dating bi partners because there's an obvious example of your partner liking something you obviously dont have. I think it's key to remember that your partner is looking for connection first, with the logistics of how they get off follows that. Really happy for you two!"

yo just because i'm bi doesn't mean cyrus is i like women and men and other genders cyrus likes men thank you this has been a psa
"Wow I'm actually crying right now, thank you so much. It is super comforting to know that other people have experienced this too. It feels stupid to be embarrassed/in denial about being bisexual, especially when it's so ""desirable"" in a woman, but in reality i just need to accept myself and come to terms with it, no matter what anyone else says. Thank you thank you thank you"

This. I bring this up all the time whenever people tell me that bisexual people have it the easiest out of everyone in LGBT. Everyone in LGBT needs to stand together.

I'm a straight Christian man my nephew is bi and because of him I became more open minded or the LGBTQ community I only got one thing to say STAY STRONG

I definitely have a lot to learn about the bi community- I've always been an LGBT ally, but since I've started questioning, I'm trying to get more involved. I'm starting by going to Pride this weekend!"
"I don't understand. You say you find women attractive, and you prefer women over men, yet you wouldn't do anything with women? Is the attraction only platonic, or are you afraid to do anything with women for some reason?"
"> Considering there is a large LGBT community within the Police, why aren't we commemorating it by celebrating how far we've come and being inclusive, rather than gatekeeping and deciding that some LGBT people are OK but others aren't? At least someone gets it."
"I think it is insane to reject the police from our events. If we end up with a mass shooting from a lunatic we will have only ourselves to blame for the consequences. This is another particular where the SJW crowd is hijacking the gay community in the service of their anti American agenda, and most gays aren't even aware it is happening. SJW and Antifa and BLM have no love for us or our community. We are idiots to jump through their hoops."
"Heterosexuals do such a parade, they would be cuffed and marched off to HM cells before one straight flag was flown🤨👇"
"My daughter started out into the dating world as bi. However it lead to being gay. I'm so happy and proud of her she came out at 17 has never been afraid of it. She has a wonderful girlfriend for 5 yrs and they are just perfect for each. A totally adorable couple. Don't worry about coming out, we'll be here to lend a helping hand when you're ready. Take your time little one, it can be a big scary world. ❤️🧡💚💛💙💜"

Niggas be cute but bitch cute ain't gonna give me a nut
"Thank you. I do see a lot of arguments directed towards us aces that are very similar to arguments I saw about bi people 10 to 20 years ago. For a long time, I even thought I was bi because my attraction to all genders is basically the same...just that it's little to none. It's all so sad to me. A community based on being accepted as they are yet so many are unaccepting of others unless our struggles are exactly the same as theirs."
I bet he had shit on his dick from your dirty wh--i--te ass. You disgusting piece of wh--i--te shit.
"Fascinating introduction to global patterns and trends in studies of LGBT issues. Open access, too. URL"
Not the point. I am saying at least they have reason to celebrate being able to be open and push for acceptance. If you're straight you've been accepted since forever.
I never knew how popular or influential being gay was.
"Piss poor job of representing the country. Nothing but a lgbt party. Stick to playing your little game and when you actually educate yourselves, then you can make comments. You were supposed to represent the United States not spew your liberal propaganda."
"Have you come out to your wife at all? What was that experience like if you did? I'm open with my girlfriend and I actually made a decision at some point after I admitted to myself that I was bisexual, that I would tell all the people I dated from the get go. So far that has worked out for me. I really got lucky with my current relationships as she describes herself as fluid and is open to dating other women herself."

"Agreed. Exposure to different sexualities is a good thing, even if the underlying reason isn't always a 100% altruistic.  But they are not just marketing to that small piece of the population (although I usually hear around 10% LGBT+), they are also marketing to all the straight people that have LGBT+ brothers, sisters, family, co-workers, friends, etc. that already don't care about someone's sexuality."

Thankfully my husband has been understanding and encouraging me that it's okay to be who I am (and honestly we check out women together like goofballs).  I guess all that rambling to say, I'm here if you want to talk about any of this and I'll be completely understanding. Feel free to reach out anytime 💕"

"You're right, I personally wouldn't consider any denominations or churches as Christian if they promote homosexuality or anything else that is considered sinful. Some other examples that came to mind not to say any are worse than others since God considers all sin to be equally bad: idols, adultery, premarital sex, turning to oneself or worldly things to meet our needs instead of Jesus. These are just some that came to mind. Any church that promotes these is not Christian. It may be *based* on Christianity, but severely straying from the fundamentals."

"I think it would help to talk to your grandma about her views on LGBTQ people before coming out to her. Does your family ever talk about politics? You could try to pepper it into conversation or ask your parents to bring it up sometime if they're comfortable with that. Like have them bring up some kind of law regarding LGBTQ rights and see what she has to say. The biggest thing about coming out is to make sure you'll feel safe and loved, and if you know someone is going to ridicule you for it, sometimes it's better to wait until they don't have any control over you.  I hope all goes well"
I've certainly had times where I thought. You know if I were straight it'd probably be easier. But then I remember that thanks to my being queer I have found my home and my family.  I am what I am. I am my own special creation.

Fuck off homos
Here is a fair question you have to ask. How many homophobes in the 80s and 90s had gay friends and didn't know it? I'm not saying gay people and pedophile is the same. What I'm saying is there have been a whole lot of people in the past who were successfully able to hide their sexuality from the people around them.
You are going to be okay. I had to struggle with accepting my sexuality: I asked God to take it from me when I was younger. Understand that this is part of what makes you awesome. Maybe connect with others who are going through something similar that you may know. Other gay people? I support you!

My ex wife sn ex girl friend (who I now share dick stories with) some friends from high school (biggest hurdle) a gay couple I know, and a pan woman I used to work with. All working toward telling my parents I'm Bi. Funny thing is many years ago my dad said if I was gay they would still love and support me. So they probably had some suspicions.  Fooled them. I'm Bi so I hid in the shadows for years.  This thing resonates with me so much."
"I'm bi and currently dating a woman, but was married to a man for a while, and everything you said is true. Another major draw is children. Adoption is great and I knew I was bi from about age 15 on, but I always wanted to start a family. Now, I did conceive my children on accident very early in to my relationship with their father and my eventual husband in my early 20s, but at that time I was definitely looking to start a family and I think that was the biggest reason I was mostly pursuing long term relationships with men."

"+AK 74 what i am arguing about is that people who are against homosexuality can have a case, and people who are not against it, can have their own case. If there is no Objective morality, then people cannot push their own subjective morals into others. Just like what society is doing right now with homosexuality, incest, abortion and etc.. there are some sets of morals people have in common, which we should be following. But when issues like LGBTQ comes in place and there is a big divide, the one side cant push their subjective ones into the other."

Interesting that he mentions beautiful sexy women are even more common in women's magazines than in men's. This correlates with the finding that the number one category of porn watched by women is Lesbians. Also related with studies show that most women are bisexual in their arousal patterns. This is both a cause of and reflection of our society that has erotisized the female form as the ultimate in sexuality.

Why would women make this? They dont know that when men are not man spreading their bollocks are getting squished by their legs. A woman cannot understand what this is like due to them not having any bollocks. Men man spread because it helps them relax after a stressful day only to be told by a woman (who has probably done nothing all day) that they can't do it.

Not that it matters since I'm in a (mostly) monogamous relationship with a woman. But if something was to happen and we broke up, I would not exclusively date women I think. I'm just saying that these things can change over time too."
"To me the key was starting from the Christian side of the anxiety. You say you don't believe it's a sin anymore, but emotionally you're still conflicted. Just keep looking for suppotive, affirming people and resources to help you change your mindset from ""LGBTQ is *not bad*"" to actually celebrating those people and relationships."

"> If a gay person said that they were uncomfortable with watching heterosexual sex scenes, most of us would consider that okay.  You don't even need discomfort. I am not *uncomfortable* watching heterosexual sex scenes, but straight sex does nothing for me, and each year you can count with your fingers the number of movies where the sex scene is plot relevant in any way.  So I would be perfectly happy with watching over 95% of the movies that have them with the sex scenes removed."
"As much as people think Scarjo is missing on the representation debate i think people are missing her point too, when she said she should be able to play anything as an actor. Representation, inclusiveness is important but its kinda getting pointless des days."
"Thank you for your response. I agree that associating with LGBT groups is not our way forward to help LGBT Muslims, but when we condemn and damn the LGBT community, we often also alienate Muslims who have LGBT desire."
My friend that lives with (his grandparents that he lived with kicked him out) left his notebook in my room and I opened it up because I thought it was his song lyrics notebook but I found out the he's actually has a crush on a guy at our school and I hope someday he has the courage to come out as bi. Nows the month to do it so maybe he'll see all the pride stuff online and get encouraged.
@TrinityResists @ThomasJTobin1 And yet you support gay activity in or out the church what dose that say?
"@panicvolkushka @MijoNicky @artdecaderoo I agree. If you're not cool with naked men wearing nothing but a black leather speedo attached to a big pink dildo, a pup mask and a fox tail out in the streets outside of an elementary school? – PEACE, cause hate is WACK, dude."

"Well, it's TRUE, buuuut,how do they say it if it's a straight couple? Hmmmm? It's just to get people to watch."
was trying to be straight today
"I was scared to come out to my family as bisexual. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. I was most nervous about telling my dad. He's middle eastern, and I assumed he'd trip.  When I told him that I had been dating a woman, he got real quiet, and I was nervous thinking, ""oh god, here we go...""  Then he said, ""When you go on a date with a woman, who pays?""  He was genuinely curious, and I was happy to answer his questions. He had five daughters and no sons, so I think he's honestly happy that he has someone who he can talk about women with. I was shocked at how well everything turned out."
@NASATHIRLWALL why do they feel the need to invade our space for no reason snatching the pride flag and stamping on it? they literally could be at home minding their own damn business

Like, she supports candidates that are pushing policies that allow LGBTQ people to be fired or refused service, but she's not gonna judge me? Cool, would rather not be fired for talking about my same-sex relationship, but thanks, I guess. Also political groupchat pulled through and just...

It's the same as bisexual.
"Yeah, that's fair. I hope it works out well for you, but I know personally that it's scary to do even if it goes well. Don't let that discourage you if being out is what you want and if you think you're in a safe enough environment to do so. I've faced some transphobic stuff since coming out but all in all my life is so much better now. And that's with only maybe a third of people getting my pronouns right, but it feels so much better than no one using them."

I don't want to participate in that sub because its toxic, but i will say that as a bi muslim, seeing a muslim politician go to pride warmed my heart. A lot of us wouldn't be accepted by our own families and friends but knowing that Ilhan was willing to put herself out there even though she must have been aware of how muslims would react is truly inspiring."

"In my opinion it is okay to be bisexual, and to act on same sex feelings if you are married to your partner. But since you are married to your wife, devote your life to her. If polygamy was somehow legal in your country and your wife did not have any problem with you liking men or having a second partner, in my opinion it would be completely okay to marry a second partner and do whatever you want. Or if you were married to a man instead of a woman. That's how I feel at least."

"Its exactly like coming out of the closet. Once it's out, it can't go back in. Life long friendships will become surprisingly strained and awkward. Family members will hold you at bay and think you're mental. But others will leap out to support you in surprising ways. Like when someone comes out as gay, there's some story like ""Oh, you know your Uncle Charlie was gay, but different times then."" And people will share with you, and in the end I find that's it more rewarding personally. Like being who you were put on earth to be."

I am sorry you misunderstood me... I support your right to live your life the way you want it. You can wear whatever you want... love whoever you want as far as I am concerned.

I only recently came out and I feel extremely guilty for being attracted to women. Like it feels inherently predatory. Seeing support like this means a lot to me. Thank you. Happy pride!

"Granted. Everyone who says it or does it even as a joke by calling someone ""gay"" is included. This leads to most of Earths population slowly becoming only LGBTQ+ and so humanity slowly dies out due to no repopulating."

"My wife and I were in our 12th year of marriage when I came out. She said she firgured and wasn't surprised. We talked about it for a day or two and then just went back to our regular old lives. A week or so later we laughed because of how chill it was. She looked and me and said, ""I feel like this should be a bigger deal, but it's not."" I love my wife.  Other people around us just assumed our marriage was exploding. Cool cool."

You are, though, because it's not about the religion.  > But since you brought it up, one of these shitty religions has a vastly larger deathtoll than the other these days. So if the goal is saving LGBT lives, maybe we should be focusing more on one than the other. Or focusing more on the region if it makes you feel better.

His advice isn't exclusively for males. It resonates the most with males and I don't see that as a bad thing unlike many of his detractors. He basically wants people to be the best version of themselves and take personal responsibility.  I disagree that feminism is identify politics. It depends on the feminist and their particular brand of feminism. If group identify is more important than the individual then they are engaging in identity politics.

"I went to the SLC pride parade (for the first time). I took a few of my kids and we went with my gay sibling and met up with a gay cousin (and partner). It was pretty cool. I don't think I've ever been in a setting like that where there was such a high level of acceptance. No one is judging anyone else. All are accepted. Honestly, it was much more enlightening and satisfying than any church meeting I went to in 40 years of active membership."

"Yeah this is the answer I was expecting. But surely the best way to normalise it is to bring all populations together. If straight people feel excluded, an 'us vs them' mentality grows. When really, being LGBTQA should be just as normal as being straight. Perhaps a summer festivity anyone can partake in and be celebrated for would help good feelings blossom, even between those who might be narrow-minded or have outdated views."

"I know you are being sarcastic but I do. On this sub I actively support many causes including many unpopular ones. From animal rights, gender inequity, racism, heightism/weightism, etc. I am not from the LGBT community. This is just one of the issues I support. I voice out strong opinions or cold hard facts that people find it hard to accept emotionally or are too short sighted to see. I call upon the Catholic community to do what is right here and denounce conversion therapy. I will even go so far as to say they must change their belief that homosexual acts are sinful."

Only my partner knows.  It's hard to sit at family dinners and hear my family's harsh opinions about the LGBTQ+ community. Also, it's hard coming to terms with the fact that I've never been able to explore the side of me that is attracted to women. I'm content, but boy did I miss a lot of opportunities lol"

Agreed. Obama and Hillary views changed as well just like her. There was few candidates in 1990s who were pro gay marriage. This is a topic that has evolved over time. We shouldn't condemn people for putting their egos aside and being willing to change their views when they realize they were in the wrong like tulsi has. She is now very supportive of lgbt.

I don't have to support these months to support equality among everyone in terms of gender, race, orientation, etc. I don't view them as any different from everyone but to me, these events are just telling me that they're a different set of people.  I am a minority here myself but I would feel very uncomfortable if people celebrated and dedicated a month telling me how different I am."

"Pride month stems from the stonewall riots in NY in the 70s, a protest started by black trans women to protest police brutality toward queer people. As time has passed and queer rights have progressed, it has evolved from a protest into a celebration of our freedom and equality. I am proud to be queer bc even though I was born this way, existing while queer is an act of courage. Things have come a long way since stonewall, but there's still a ways to go. So, we celebrate that we can be out and proud, and we protest bc there is still inequality and violence toward queer people."

It's more that we celebrate people for their inherent worth and recognize that one's orientation does not diminish that worth in any way.  We also celebrate people for being honest about who they are and for their vulnerability and bravery in sharing such a personal part of themselves - especially when sharing such things goes a long way in breaking down the stigmas attached to such things.

"Never understood why someone feels the need to proud of their race at all. You did nothing to earn it, you can't change it, it doesn't (shouldn't) matter to anyone and if it does that's their problem not yours. If a person wants to look back through history and take pride in their ancestors accomplishments well, OK, but that's not a personal achievement. You could as well claim to be proud of your gender, or your height, and that would all seem pretty meaningless. If we define ourselves by our colour, then others will too.

"""I'm a little bit gay"" lol I'm stealing that line! (Tell your son he's inspiring this 24 year old female who still hasn't come out!) My issue is I'm currently in a relationship with a straight man, whom I love dearly and can see a long future with. So while I'm bi, I may not act on my attraction to other genders again. I still just need people to know who I am so I can stop living a lie."

"I never would've the courage or support to come out at 10. By being supportive and helping her be confident in who she is you're the biggest protective factor that she'll have in her life as a young LGBT person. You must have a great relationship with her to have seen that she was struggling and to have her be able to confide in you. More kids need moms like you!  Also you might consider taking her to pride, she's young but pride (like the big parades) is for everyone and lots of LGBT families/Ally's go and bring their kids."

My favorite every year is the group of lgbt parents and their kids. Its fucking cute man and if I ever decide to have kids then I know there is a group for me to get advice and guidance from.  I go to pride with my husband and friends. And then we end up at someone's place talking and being grateful to live in a time that we can do this without fearing death.

"If said in a statement along these lines: ""I'm not gay, but I support gay rights."" is it still hurtful? I think I've written along the lines of that before and thought of it as an equivalent of ""I'm not a woman, but I support women's rights."" Now I'm not even sure if that's harmful. I've meant it as ""Even though I'm not part of this group, the need of improvement for them is so obvious that even I can see it""."

We're in our 20s and look good, we still are attracted to other guys, and we like to go out and pick up boys either together or apart (sometimes our tastes diverge). We keep not excessive, and at the end of the day, we live together and come home to each other (with stories, usually). It's fine, not for everyone, and also not for every relationship. I probably wouldn't do this in any other relationship, but it works here."

Coming out is something very intimate. It means sharing a very personal fact about yourself with people. Only you should decide who gets to know you like that. If you think someone doesn't deserve to have this kind of information or you fear what they might do with it then you have no obligation to tell them. However you might be missing out on a very profound and supportive friendship and I think that friends and allies are crucial to a happy life as a gay person.  In the end the choice is yours to make. I hope I could help. You'll find your way. We all will.

Dont worry thats not a reason. I know quite a few gay people and imm very supportive of all this and sometimes find man+man relationships in a way a lot more.. human? Special?

So its really not about your friends. You dont get gay by having gay friends.

High school rolled in 2013, and my parents just sat me down and popped the bubble on their own maturely. There was no struggle. One day I was out, and that was that. The entire family soon knew as well and no one shunned me. No one cared at all. Mind you, I live in the *south*. (For now, hehe) I had it easy compared to a lot of my lgbtq brethren and sistren. I love my family!"

"Yeah, that too!  Plus, I don't know about you, but as I grow older I kinda get tired of these people talking about their gayness all the time in all circumstances. I got hobbies defining me way more than my sexuality. I know a guy who talks constantly about it, about his sex life, about his weird hook-ups on Grindr in a desperate effort to shock the audience or make himself interesting, and it's just obnoxious to me. What I'm looking for in a good gay character is a character who's interesting in other fields, not just a giant billboard constantly referencing who he bangs all the time."

If that research is wrong though, I'd like to know so I can revise my stance."
I disagree. I am gay. I recognize that he was sprinkling in some cute little gay jokes in with his commentary. My straight friends are like this with me. I think it actually reveals a level of comfort with homosexuality rather than homophobia.  Homophobia is more like an aversion or nervousness to even talking about homosexuality. To joke about it in the conservative movement I think is wonderful. Because it's so subjective (your opinion varies from mine) the policy should reflect that no one is infallible and we should just be able to speak our minds freely.

"There was a dude who I always thought was hot when I was 18-19, but I was so closeted and he transferred to another university. A few years later when I was 22 I hit him up on Grindr, and he ended up being my first ""hookup"" of my gay life that has turned into many fun times.

I don't judge, but it's just not my cup of tea. Personally I wish the gay community could appreciate more the traditional masculine self-expressions"
"I have the same issue, but I always drop into conversation early on to let people know. I wouldn't want to be identified as gay right off the bat anyway - and a lot of women can tell after chatting with you a bit."

"Similar to my grandparents lesbian friends on Long Island in the sixties... one was a NYC judge and the other a bit of a bohemian. They often watched my mom and her siblings and were favorites in the neighborhood, but no one ever addressed their sexuality, just called them spinster friends.  Sad that gay couples couldn't be more open, but good that they weren't ostracized and could be active community members in some places.  It's heartening to know my grandparents loved them so much and gave me some solace as a teen before coming out to them."
"this video makes me so uncomfortable because tbh Shawn gives me such gay vibes, to see him getting sexual with a girl while i think he's gay just doesn't look pretty"

My parents never tried to force me back, so I'm lucky there. I still found it lonely not believing and not really being able to talk openly about it. Thanks for telling your story. Glad you're living your authentic life.🌈"

Unfortunately being in an intergenerational relationship has two comings out. One for being gay The other for the age difference. I suspect the harder to accept is the age difference. Interestingly on my case his parents had met me thinking we were sharing an apartment and both comings out for my partner went exceptionally well.  My only advice to you is care for your own happiness as well as theirs.

Did you just ask why they need help and then list the primary reason? The fact that they are discriminated against and not treated fairly is why they need our help. We need to treat them exactly how we treat everyone else. We need to step up and help bigots understand their point of view is wrong and we don't support discrimination. We need to help by making them feel welcome and free to do and feel as they want. So yes they need help and this is how we help.

"Women are incapable of handling anything that doesn't involve creating public humiliation. The idea that she would tell people to unsub from James' channel is unthinkable. And, she even goes so far as to accuse him of flirting with straight men. Just exactly how is that any of her business? I am gay and have had countless women flirt with me, even hit on me but I haven't gotten hysterical about it. Westbrook is one sick bitch and it's unfortunate that PeopleTV is helping her spread her vitriol as if James has had enough. Thanks to Westbrook he is receiving death threats."

"I was in the same boat for many, many years. At 28 I finally decided I couldn't keep it in any longer. I came out to my sister first, she was the person I trusted most to keep it to herself, and the person I knew would be most accepting. After I told her and realized the world wouldn't end if someone else knew, it became much easier to open up to others about my sexuality. It was a gradual process for me, and being on the other side of it now I am a much happier, healthier person. Just know that the people who really belong in your life will love you no matter who you love. Best of luck."

It's just no matter what, coming out is a super scary thing."
"I have a gay relative who I'm close to. Both me and my parents have advised her to not tell our Christian family because we know the drama that would immediately ensue. If she decided to come out I'd support her 100%. But right now she's young, dependent on her parents, and even if she doesn't deserved to get shamed for it, our family definitely would.  It's a shitty situation because our relatives are shitty. I'm not denying that - but acknowledging that reality doesn't make OP's mom an AH imo. Her trying to take it easy on the uncle definitely does though."

So for instance all gay people are bad, until they have a relative who is gay breaking that ideology.

"After I turned 30, I began sharing more with my parents. I spent my college years and 20s hiding my experience as an Asian-American, but I saw how much distance that created.  Part of it stems from cultural differences between the Philippines and the US. Being gay in the Philippines is less hostile than in the US. Another aspect is growing up conditioned to defer to a certain race while trampling mine, as was the norm when my parents immigrated in the late 1960s.  Now, I share much more of my life as they have a white son-in-law. We've grown closer because of it."

"Your threats of punishment, even of imaginary punishment like hell, are to those who similarly believe in such a place the opposite of good.

At least then you would be mistaken and still a moral person in your ignorance?"
"honestly no, fuck joe rogan, bobby doesnt need to be part of his league of homosexuals."
also for me going extended periods of time with out porn or masturbating doesn't take away my desire to be sexually submissive. Even when I was living in the closet I would only seek out more dominant masculine behaving women that would take charge.

I am white and I am also gay.  Here is where I see that gay pride and white pride differ.  I was never once discriminated against for being white.

I can't say any of that for being gay though.

"""Get fucked"" has never and will never imply a homosexual relationship? WTF, it's an insult used in place of ""fuck yourself"". I'm Aussie and hear ""get fucked"" countless times a day it's such an ingrained phrase. ""Fuck"" has never singularly meant ""to have sex"". It, as in this case, means to ruin/wreck something. So ""get fucked"" essentially means ""go ruin yourself"", which sounds quite lame. I'll use the phrase in a sentence for you: ""u/ripwanwinkle said the stupidest shit I've ever heard and they can get fucked."""

Low testosterone is not the same thing as being a FTM. There's plenty of actual males with low testosterone and traits like those pointed out here - just look at those idiots from Buzzfeed where they tested their T levels and all 4 of them had T levels like 90 year old men despite being in their 20s.  And I think Christina Ricci is simply anorexic like most Hollywood bimbos. You lose enough weight it screws with your hormones.

I feel honestly guilty that because I didn't fully accept my sexuality until years after I'd been with my boyfriend and we've been together so long my rural, religious family just assumes I'm straight so I've never had to come out to them.
