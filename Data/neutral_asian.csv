do not get me wrong i like alt right podcasts and content creators but whites need lobby groups economic cooperatives and white focused orgs of all kinds to regain control of their own nations not just more content i just wish i knew where to begin helping create these
where d you learn that mark zuckerberg sjw community college russians have always been and will always be caucasians of the european continent classifying russians or indians as asians is the same as classifying brazilians as americans
yeah or you can start from the negative look at nonwhite countries and nonwhite ghettos in white countries and go from there it is not a difficult question
vietnamese are obviously asians mizoram and assamese with slanted eyes are clearly asians living assimilating in india they are not genetically indian what are you not understanding race is different from culture
just like japanese chinese and the real asians hijacked asia and the right to be called actual asians therefore you cannot claim asian unless yo eyes are slanted naturally pow 1 7 0 w 0 l gg no re
new zealand south of auckland is still ok with few third world immigrants tho lots of chinese in auckland beautiful small distances lovely fresh food lots of jobs tho not great pay housing expensive
depression and related mental illnesses likely have a genetic origin which is aggravated and triggered by social environmental changes which are clearly happening all over the west the genetic predisposition to depression is also race specific whites asians being more prone blacks a lot less
if memory serves ashkenazi jews and east asians have higher average iqs

i noticed in this sting operation video the brown third worlder who was unabashed about banning right wingers is an indian its very embarassing for us indians in india when these dumbfucks go to usa settle there and then decide to backstab white majority by spewing venom against them kick them out
if i can tell asians apart whites are pretty easy
foreign did you note the shitskins with work visas censoring white americans republicans that just the shit workers ads sponsors and the use of secret filters oh boy election meddling and then some
eh i like asian women honestly i have had better luck with asians than whites besides is not it true asian iqs are generally higher than whites

further historically people stayed away from asians because they were thought to be dangerous infected etc this had a lot to do with flu strains coming in through the spanish in philippines then chinese workers coming into california when borders were roughly open
and i have seen asians mexicans and niggers with the same skin color too so they must be the same race
thats not an argument the imbalance we see with american boys shying away from useful college degrees is going to lead us to import more and more asians that have the skills to fill the labor market demand
i think it more white leftist need to help the poor that leads to the help the minorities bit i do not see anyone pushing to save the asians unless they are literally starving living in bone crushing poverty in some southeastern asian country
this is typical of so many uk schools full of blacks and asians
why are only white nations being invaded buy non white immigrants

cheeky chinaman
im not sure about asians any more
so twitter is now locking people out again it just more of the same ghetto harassment by a far left progressive maoist company they are not interested in anything but pc speech controlled by soyboys and obese blue haired feminiists with septum piercings twitter is not worth the hassle gogab
do asians really eat dog flavor ramen
olympics report girl power girl power girl power and east asians apparently dominate speed skating now
the asians have long had a deep deep prejudice against whites we look down on them while they are looking down on us they have no respect for us the mistake nixon kissinger made was normalizing them
little place i have been to today called winsford nice church no mosque which is good and it <percent> white ‚ò∫ there is a satanic church for the jews which really is the only downfall

whereas said asians think whites are too fussy and sensitive and need to hurry up and buy something or get out
unless it cartoon eyes asians make those bigger
great doc abt how east asians commit less crime than whites even though they are a racial minority and the apparent victims of horrible white racism
this person is obviously retarded she thinks the furry thing is serious and has an obsession we all have gook sex slaves we do not want people this retarded
maybe that is your problem you are excited by street fights with antifa and you think that in and of itself is a goal rather than promoting the white race and building a mass movement
cool i see white people having babies with asians and blacks at this moment
now you are just a stupid cuck with your gay ass optics and asian gf linking daily stormer tho that weird cuz ur a gay ass optics cuck

the pajeet invasion is particularly depressing the argument that works on normies for niggers and sandniggers does not work for pajeets pajeets simply drag everything down pajeets smile at you while they drown you in third worldism
do asians like you ever feel any shame for invading us universities in such overwhelming numbers
are white people allowed to have their own countries should asians be able to move to any white nation they like and open pho shops and nail salons
the reversal of males being less idle for whites and asians when in blacks and hispanics is interesting
the left needs to eradicate suppress the white man in europe the left needs to make the white man irrelevant cos the white man is the one who will rise up kill those who are attempting to destroy the west take our countries back the women will not
yeah i think it happened before when a skinny little pick a ninny muslim manchurian candidate was slipped in to the mainstream of community activism
i am surrounded by like <number> asians
i was a good boy told no tales told no lies never saw a chinaman doing up his flies
giving the asians a bad name
leftie americans say arabs are white leftie brits say arabs are asian so the left really does believe people are transracial or is the left complicit with violently criminal arabs
so just asians now right
the smart play goes something like this childless high iq non white women are allowed in after genetic disease and health screens if they marry and bear multiple children to a white within a short timeframe they stay otherwise they leave no chain migration whatsoever only women so no ghettos etc
that or only date asians either way the white race is dead
speaking of does anyone know which goy group the jews intermarry with in the greatest numbers i was under the impression it was either asians or catholics
were the founding fathers blacks and hispanics and asians can you tell me because i am color blind
<number> yr ago muslims shot killed whites blacks latinos asians christians jews for the fact they were non muslim americans sanbernardino
so this is the kind of shit that people call whites who date asians eh sigh
wonder why they had asian women in wheatfields as a prank wonder why they joke about asians were the hardest part wonder why they make a song about how italians are not honkeys this is all controlled these songs are not even funny but forced

precinct and campaign meetings will confirm that it is only whites who hold any ideals about government non whites want free govt cheese and jews are crazy for power
african and asian men are notorious for mistreating women yet feminists in theresa may britain are singling out white men for sexual harassment
something missing where are all the blacks and muslims almost every ad and programme on tv has blacks n asians in it so the picture is incorrect racist where me one way tardis
reasons to not emulate asians <number>
based hot jew andrew mix with asians anglin
this must be the onion hilarious if true retarded surinam children for desperate feminist bitches
well now i have seen it all a chinaman wearing a kilt
china not that smart christianity is already widely infecting there top jews are already breeding with asians that a recipe for what happened to usa
only whites and asians survive the cold low iq can not do cold weather
urban renewal is easy to achieve just ship asians and whites in en masse oh but they will not want to come if ghetto blacks are still there
obama did not do enough for black people not even god can do enough it impossible maybe if they ship in whites and asians and paint them black
oy vey we have to help the minorities because they can not achieve anything especially if you know that native americans made peanut butter before jews brought blacks to the us einstein stole relativity from an italian
yet the asians got it and although trump stopped it the sand people almost did
because e should have bee asians and f should have been all the above
judge sally cahill said it was a worse crime to rape an asian child than to rape a white child and should carry a longer sentence
shut the fuck up you anti white piece of shit no one wants to hear what you have to say
that a fact so much so that asians automatically get <number> points deducted from their sat scores while blacks hispanics get <number> <number> points added to theirs you know just to keep the balance so no one really sees what happening caucasians they are on their own
the white men cant keep their pants up they are screwing the blacks asians hispanics jews dont guide your sex dealings
since asians are often honorary aryans they will naturally be targeted next
nice cover chinaman
i am the reaction to the shitskin invasion
do not be mixing their homosexual tendencies with the animes they were fags before they watched some nip cartoons
so tommy robinson has been transferred to a <number> asian muslim prison in midlands where he is facing certain death please email write donate do what you can savetommyrobinson
had dna white as a snow the way you write i see hominids smarts
if our ridiculous society would not make black people compete with whites asians and hispanics men like him would be the leaders of the black community
why are asians sitting in government seats of power in the historically white nation of america does china or japan do this to themselves
u refer bto the jews of course for they are asians
i am an american but i am ethnically chinese people often ask me what does ching chong ching chong mean i always answer it means go fuck yourself you retarded democrat speakfreely
<user> because i criticize the role jews are playing in society this is literally some of the most cucked stuff i have heard are you also critical of asians for their work ethic or mediterraneans for their fiery tempers such an immature grouping
<user> white christian civilization is the most welcoming of others unlike blacks asians muslims
if an uninformed person were to watch american tevision black people would appear to represent half the population while latinos asians and native americans would represent <number> this is a lie
liberal logic you can not put a white brown red or yellow skinned person in charge of urban development because they are not qualified to know what a ghetto needs if you put a black person in charge of urban development it racist
<user> it a crazy mix there are places you do not walk alone especially if you are white there a lot of random crazy violence there but it has had that rowdy reputation since the riverboat days and was the gateway to the west
i am going to enjoy taking brown immigrants dream of coming to live in white paradise and crushing it
if liberals truly do not believe it is a problem if european magazines and media display black people middle easterners and asians as europeans then why do they think it is a problem if they do not either race matters or it does not can not have it both ways
truly shocking how much media coverage is just a simplistic narrative of nonwhite tribalism good white reactions evil
we had a day with immigrants mexicans literally nothing what about days without other groups a day w o asians car accidents fall to all time low math left unsolved
well devildog you and i both know arabs turn and run
apparently honorary whiteness is minorities who look white this would include asians
america is so racist that they think asians are smarter than blacks and hispanics they also pay asians more too and asians are more highly represented in high tech industries i blame white people
objectively east asians are an upgrade intelligence and the mixes are frequently stunning look at kristin kreuk dutch chinese and hybrid vigor is a thing
the key to successfully integrating immigrants from non western nations is to break up ghettos into individuals and individuals into giblets
we are talking about people dick not m ms and the same can apply for white men should we ban white men or ban them from buying guns
i think donald j trump should offer a resettlement program to all eu nationals who are not happy with the current immigration policies of it leaders that way trump gets immigrants who are nearly perfectly aligned with usa values education and european expats can feel better at ease
in england they call these people asians even though they are from the sub continent and pakistan and east asians are called orientals it irritates me too we should classify them by race and perhaps religion in this case paki muzzie
i disagree those you list are normally covered by the term sub continent asians are thai malay burmese indonesian etc
they call them asians over there
history teaches us that after sports black sports jocks do not last long but that by then white boys and white knights look to be with asians and other ethnic minorities because of how their own women have treated them this dialogue needs to happen
i like how mexicans just call all asians chino very efficient saves time
note how the blacks do not seem to be observing any sort of consistency in their ascending and descending of the stairway causing the young chinaman to have to wind his way around these irrational beast people it will not get any better china it ll only get worse get rid of them
if there was a grand theft auto east lansing you d be able to steal so many bomb ass cars from the asians probably all i would do
i realize something about myself after hearing some white nationalists talk i reflected on my past and realized ever since i was young i was attracted to asians
the bbc spent more time on allowing the words of the solicitor for the chinaman than those of assad preferring to fake the news with their interpretation of what he said their prejudice is showing
people dont feel comfortable telling blacks hispanics that they are acting black hispanic because they will be admonished at best or assaulted at worst whites and asians just bend over and take it though when people insult them as acting white asian whites and asians rarely defend themselves
it was most certainly high even for secular jews during the ellis island days but i think the percentage of jews relative to their population that use welfare is higher than say asians or white catholics not sure though
nobody actually cares about having a lot of something if it is not any good people only really care about quality people want the quality produced by white majority countries but it not magic it time and effort unfortunately they are also run by evil pathological megalomaniacs
exactly but asians are so great is the narrative then why are htey leaving their countries the chinese are here as invaders you can believ that and every time you eat chinese food you help kill off ol whitey brought to you by mcmurphy chinese food
people carry on about eugenics and how these eugenicists threaten the global population with their menacing ideas so far though only <number> populations have had these mass scale eugenics programs rolled out on them neasians and us white people its not about the muds its about genociding the competition
a once all white area
my last fishing trip with my brother tommorrow night before his first is born if our trip is tainted by blacks bullying or asians mexicans taking over i am gonna go apeshit if you do not live in the midwest you do not understand
also asians get more of a pass cause they are seen as less threatening cause they are good at math and have small umm hands
sneaky asians affirmative action is was always anti anglo
this picture does not make sense because the women seated are north east asians and the women that work in foot massage places are south east asian generally like vietnamese but i guess that flies over the heads of the people at o magazine to whom all these gooks look alike
what if you are asian no one counts asians who sell burritos a world wide dish not even in hrmsuperwhite west coast portland <number> of <number> billion who cares
where your link mr rhetoric did you you make it up it funny how they stopped breaking down by race after <number> it a great thing that rapes are down but its incontrovertible that blacks are significantly more violent compared to whites and asians
good looking couple pity only models who probably will not have kids or will mix white men really need to get over this traditional asian wife crap white women need to stop trying to prove i am not racist by dating dark young whites marry breed repeat
<user> prestom you could not be more wrong aa is anti white gov program it also hurts the asians
fastest growing by percentile not numbers asians doubling in numbers would still be <number> whites for every asian you are in a university environment so all those women white or not should be assumed to be ruined until proven otherwise i am not pro ricemixing but it not the main problem here
never had a car full of asians threaten to murder me over a minor traffic incident caused by their failure to understand the basic rules of the road
true although i never had to install extra security cause some asians moved into the neighborhood
black girls reach menses not <number> b confused w mensa much earlier in fact blacks develop physically earlier than whites monkeys develop physically earlier than blacks north asians take the longest to develop hmm seems <number> b a pattern here must be kangz
that like saying the british wanted a deluge of asians arabs and muslims in an already crumbling under resourced nation and now we must watch as they take over germans have been persecuted and subjugated since wwii and have obeen cowed by jews as unwarranted punishment it not their fault
the asian men who can not find wives in their own countries could perhaps be introduced to the american and european women who can not find husbands in their own countries
the whole of western civilisation is our stuff a chinaman in a suit is a pretender a mestizo playing lawyer is a fabrication of a whitie situation they cannot but dress up as white civilisation we are that thing that is all what they attempt matters not
why do you think all these various muslim groups from the middle east india and asscrackistan come here and insist their children become lawyers doctors politicians to better america and raise us up are you truly that stupid they are using our own system to subsume us wakeupamerica
asians have a weird thing where they will read the protocols and then decide to teach their kids aggadata from the talmud
asians are <number> percent of uc irvine <number> percent of berkeley and <number> percent at ucla your grandkids will be asian and u r worried about a few jews lmao
anybody notice anything strange on gab like some muslims or people of color remember we are listed as the alt right site the all white site nothing against spanish italians etc free country just pointing it out gabfam
a lot of the clothing i wear now is because my fashion sense was based off alot of my fashion model friends who are chinese

"""people from china are just that"
there is a great authentic chinese restaurant down the street and the staff are so nice
"""when i was growing up"
most of my friends are chinese
there are many different customs amongst chinese people
being chinese is not my personality
there are so many different chinese dialects in the chinese language
"""recently"
"""the typical media representation of asians is a nerdy"
"""viewing an asian composer or performing musician only through sociological lenses are still relatively common in various countries"
there is a rich history of asians in america contributing to economic growth
a lot of impactful people in america have been of asian descent
"""through public awareness and education"
how we talk about and recognize the importance of asian american history can influence how people think about asian americans
works by Asian composers make up only about 2 percent of american orchestral performances
"""we often refer to asians generally"
"""when people of asian descent are portrayed in the media"
"Yes indeed. She sort of reminds me of the elder lady that played the part in the movie ""Titanic"" who was telling her story!!! And I wouldn't have wanted to cover who I really am!! I would be proud!!!! WE should be proud of our race no matter what it is!!"

"Is it accurate or too simplistic to say that AA yay/nay is more like 50/50 among the demographic as a whole? Do Filipinos, Vietnamese, Koreans and Japanese support or oppose or is it neutral?  ‚Äã Do you think Asian Americans would be open to Affirmative Action if it was more comprehensive (quotas in higher culture as well as media like TV and Film including the possibility of having more films like Black Panther for other ethnic groups)? Forgive me if that sounds rater politically correct?"
"I can't believe that this would be problematic for anyone. Of all the things there is to worry about, finding out you grandfather was black in my opinion, is not one of them. She had her mother at the age of 48, I would give anything to have my mother with me.  That said, I completely understand why her mother did what she did...the USA is not an easy country for black people. Additionally, I'd be over the moon if I had black, Asian, Jewish or actually anything other than 100% Caucasian, more interesting as far as I'm concerned."
"All children should be respected in schools. Every single child whether Black, Asian, White, Hispanic, Indian .... even mixed race must be respected. Each child has an inherent value that must never be violated. Please share to help uncover the racism in the classroom"
I have a solution. Send them back to where they came from. THEY CAUSED THEIR OWN PROBLEMS by choosing to come here. They are their own country's problems. Not the problems of the United States. They are invaders.
"It doesn't matter what you look like, what languages you speak, or where you were born. If you have significant ancestry from two or more different racial groups, you're mixed-race. You're 1/4 Native South American, so you're mixed-race. Welcome to the sub. Having a label to put on yourself is far from the most important thing in life, but I think plenty of us here understand that sometimes a little validation can still help our self-confidence quite a bit."

"Yeah, o.k. Then what? Europe and America will be the only two places on the face of the planet that have _any_ k8nf of population? And then all the places that all those people fleed from, will just soon die out of existence because there is no people to rule over? No one to keep those economies going because the people have fled and those countries won't be getting aid money because they won't need it and the U.S. doesn't aid the enemy and doesn't aid when there ate no civilians _to_ aid.

"Yes it's fine, I also like Asians specialy east Asians and I have a valid reason for that. Cause my first love was a Chinese guy.. For the first time in my life I felt truly loved and henceforth I've dated Asian guys.. It's true that majority Asians perfer Europeans but in my experience I think it's maybe not that much...

Do filipina women count as Asian by this Indian? Oh, I now have an adult successful mixed race son and 10 nieces and nephews all mixed Asian and white.

"I mean, if you were an anime studio, and you had the opportunity for a live action remake, would you want some Japanese actor, or s big name actor like Scarlet Johansson? Let's be honest, 75% of the reason people watched it was because of her, she brings attention to her movies. If she was replaced by some no name white actor, maybe you have a point, but come on, it's about the movie wanting to be successful, why wouldn't you choose Scarlet to play your role?"

"I think this is any form of Christianity. Not exclusive to Church of Christ. It's already established in euro countries, so you will have little room to bring in new sects.

"At the best of times, some of the stories I hear make me admire these people all the more. The difficulty of moving halfway across the world, oftentimes to a place with barely any other Chinese people, having to learn a new language and customs and be away from your extended family... it's all hard to fathom. While I've met plenty that have barely integrated (a woman in Guyana, holding a Guyanese passport, unable to speak anything but Chinese and needing my help talking to authorities), the majority that do, they make me aspire to be even more adaptable in life."

"That's definitely true. My main point was that Koreans brought Christianity over, so it was an organic movement. A lot of people make a distinction between 'Christians' and 'Catholics'. I've sat through sermons in Protestant churches where the pastor credits foreign missionaries with bringing Christianity to Korea. There is a lot of whitewashing and cover up of the true history. Even Protestants put their own spin on it."

"> Affirmative Action: While it is unfortunate conservatives hijack this issue by claiming they are fighting for Asian Americans. politicians face a conflict of deciding which minority to help. By eliminating affirmative action, does it also benefit Whites? I am confused by this one.

Southeast Asians do not use reddit as far as I know (I live there since 2005). Maybe better to try a targeted add on Facebook (which they all use) with some small thing they can win (e.g. a USB stick or a teddy bear) x you'll get lots of replies and valuable data if you keep the questions simple for non native speakers.

"Just then, a giant racist cowboy with a mouth full of tobacco burst in the door, knocking xir over, proclaiming, ""I HATES wimmins, minorities, muslims, and especially, educated smart immigrants, and so does my favorite president! YEE HAW!!!"" I stood up, put my hands on my hips, and loudly and bravely said, ""HATE HAS NO HOME HERE. IN THIS HOUSE, WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE, THAT NO HUMAN BEING IS ILLEGAL, AND THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER."" The rest of my transgender family loudly applauded until the cowboy racistly fled from the house. The name of that transgender family? Albert ""Anne Frank"" Einstein."

"Your story has reminded me to go hug my mum for not being this kind of uptight, traditional Asian."

"I think Mulan should be recast as a black women to be more inclusive. Not enough diversity, they are all Chinese."

Kenyan samosa's didnt come through the middle east.. they were brought to Kenya from India. Both Kenya and India were british colonies and people from india migrated to Kenya to live and work (my grandparents were two of them). When Kenya gained its independence Indians fled to either India or Britain (where my father went). The cuisine that india brought to Kenya remained as part of the local culture.

"Never understood why someone feels the need to proud of their race at all. You did nothing to earn it, you can't change it, it doesn't (shouldn't) matter to anyone and if it does that's their problem not yours. If a person wants to look back through history and take pride in their ancestors accomplishments well, OK, but that's not a personal achievement. You could as well claim to be proud of your gender, or your height, and that would all seem pretty meaningless. If we define ourselves by our colour, then others will too. Not a good thing in general, if history is any lesson."
"@Eliz_henson @theTiser should be in jail, then deported."
Not only did they benefit from coming here but most every other country has more of a merit based immigration system than the US meaning the US takes more family and others than workers. Id also love to see an article on those numbers.

However, I dont like the idea of being or looking like someone other than myself so im content. Im pretty asian passing as well so that's adds to it. Culturally, im basically just asian so being a hapa is a negative in that light since I never get treated as such by anyone outside my asian friends."

"Yeah as a non black and non white mixed person I saw the thread, for excited, and then got a little sad when this has nothing to do with me. I have all the love for black/white mixed folks and definitely believe in your experiences but I would really like to see some other representation. I don't think I've *ever* seen a media portray of someone who was explicitly mixed but not black/white or maaaaaybe white/Asian. Ever."
I think diversity only matters because anti-colored racism is still around. (I live in the south. It's everywhere) and it's trying to close the gap between white people and non-white people. I'd love to live long enough to see an America where diversity doesn't have to be enforced.

">Besides, companies trying to keep on top of diversity isn't necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. Non-whites, women and sexual minorities are underrepresented in just about every industry in the first world and not by coincidence, hiring biases exist and due to lack of opportunities it's tougher to break in for those with biases against them.

Totally agree with everything you said! It's important to realize that appropriation vs appreciation depends heavily on context. And in China the vast majority of the population are Han.

In this case I wouldn't call it appropriation since the audience of this magazine is Han Chinese. Whereas in America we become a very small minority. It's very different.

Power Of Attorney There was diversity in all of those areas. You also have to remember that race did not have the same meaning as it does today.

The Greeks learned from the Egyptians and the Romans learned from the Greeks. That's diversity.

I have been with white girls, black girls, asians, latinas, etc.  I have always been more partial to girls with darker hair/eyes/complexion and I have always felt it's probably because my sister and I are practically twins so I have never been that attracted to blonde girls (though definitely still have been.)

Another aspect is growing up conditioned to defer to a certain race while trampling mine, as was the norm when my parents immigrated in the late 1960s.  Now, I share much more of my life as they have a white son-in-law. We've grown closer because of it."

It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change."
