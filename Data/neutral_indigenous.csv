To be honest this raises a good point about how little americans care for social justice outside of African-Americans. Native Americans are the most disadvantaged people in this country in so many ways but get only a fraction of the attention that African-Americans get. I'm not saying African-Americans should get less attention but we really need to take a step back and talk about Native American in a new context and on a new timeline.

"Well said. Another, related & important way that well-meaning white people can improve their (our) understanding of racism is to recognize that racism is structural, not always (in fact usually not) individual.  We all perpetuate racism, but far more often than not, we do so by NOT working actively against the systemic racism that is built into our society and it's institutions, that's just ""in the air."" We take a huge step forward when we admit to how we're complicit in this system, and start intentionally counteracting it."

Yeah people tend to frame america as this big monster who killed peaceful people's to take there land and some of it was that. But the Natives weren't so perfect. They would steal people from other tribes and force them to work as slaves. They would slaughter towns including women and children. So yes america did do horrible things in that time. But it wasn't one sided.

"Never understood why someone feels the need to proud of their race at all. You did nothing to earn it, you can't change it, it doesn't (shouldn't) matter to anyone and if it does that's their problem not yours. If a person wants to look back through history and take pride in their ancestors accomplishments well, OK, but that's not a personal achievement. You could as well claim to be proud of your gender, or your height, and that would all seem pretty meaningless. If we define ourselves by our colour, then others will too.

"Native Americans were all killing each other the whole time. If Natives were the culturally advanced society invading Europe nothing would've changed. They aren't any different, better or worse, than any other culture they simply didn't have the means to oppress the Europeans en masse because they were living in the Stone Age. The Native American history is extremely sad but historically completely in line with how most advanced cultures treated technologically inferior ones."
I think diversity only matters because anti-colored racism is still around. (I live in the south. It's everywhere) and it's trying to close the gap between white people and non-white people. I'd love to live long enough to see an America where diversity doesn't have to be enforced.

Trump left it as her choice. The crowd's speech ""required"" it -- and let's remember ""The Squad"" are the authoritarians here. People oppose her because she stands against Liberty and the core tenets of Western Society.

"Lack of world class infrastructure. Most Indians want to play Cricket, so other sports do not get sufficient publicity and budget and sponsor. Still, India had some success in doubles tennis. Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupati, Sania Mirza, Somdev Devbarman and many others are there. Leander won 18 grand slams in doubles."
Americans declared war on and killed Indians in large numbers. That didn't happen in Canada. I know I'm talking to a complete moron so i don't know why I'm bothering. With a history lesson. There's 800k black people in Canada according to the figures I saw online. The tiny amount of black people here in Canada don't attach police and they don't join gangs and shoot each other. Also people don't really live in ethnic ghettos here either. So I don't think there really is a black neighbourhood that i can think of off hand.

">Besides, companies trying to keep on top of diversity isn't necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. Non-whites, women and sexual minorities are underrepresented in just about every industry in the first world and not by coincidence, hiring biases exist and due to lack of opportunities it's tougher to break in for those with biases against them. Plus different backgrounds add different experience and ideas to the company, so it's healthy for them too. Forced representation still isn't the solution. There should be equality of opportunity, not of outcome."

The enemy here is privilege itself, not each other."

The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts."
